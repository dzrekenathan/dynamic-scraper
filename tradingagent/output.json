The tariff takes effect on March 4. Pittsburgh-based Alcoa, which produces aluminum in Canada, Iceland, Australia and elsewhere, had trimmed its output in the United States in recent years partly due to electricity costs. Reuters • 1 hour ago Canada's Scotiabank, BMO wait for clarity on tariffs to update outlook Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia and Bank of Montreal said on Tuesday they would wait for clarity on U.S. government tariffs to build more rainy-day reserves and take actions to manage risks. The banks, Canada's third and fourth largest, put aside over C$1 billion in loan loss reserves in the first quarter ended January 31 to shield against bad loans amid tariff uncertainty that could slow loan demand. U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday said his plan to impose a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico was \"on time\" and expected to take effect on March 4.

U.S. President Donald Trump said last week that he intends to impose auto tariffs in the neighbourhood of 25% and similar duties on semiconductors and pharmaceutical imports, the latest in a series of threats that could upend international trade. Vanguard Chairman Leuh Fang told analysts on a post-earnings call that the company was adopting a \"wait and see\" stance as it was unclear how serious and far the Trump administration would go. Reuters • 6 hours ago Analysis-South Korea political turmoil pushes companies to take tariff matters into their own hands South Korea's business leaders are taking action to offset the threat posed by U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive trade policies, hiring his former aides and lobbying Republican states out of frustration with delays by their own government which is mired in a political crisis. Trump's sweeping and sometimes indiscriminate trade measures have sparked existential debate in many international capitals over how much they can depend on the U.S. from trade to politics. While it remains to be seen how the upheaval may affect the long-standing alliance and close economic relationship between Washington and Seoul, the stakes are higher for South Korea than other countries, as it grapples with the worst political crisis in decades after impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol briefly imposed martial law on December 3.

Reuters • 11 hours ago Stock market today: Wall Street falls as US consumers get more pessimistic about inflation, tariffs Wall Street is falling again Tuesday as U.S. households get more pessimistic about the economy because of inflation, tariffs and other policies coming from Washington.

As the Southeast Asian nation has one of the largest surpluses with the U.S. and meets several criteria for potential reciprocal tariffs, Vietnamese officials and foreign companies are taking the threats seriously. Many economists agree Vietnam's levies on U.S. products are higher than duties the U.S. charges.

The Southeast Asian nation experienced a surge in foreign investment after the first Trump administration started a trade war with Beijing in 2018, as foreign multinationals moved factories from China to its southern neighbour to avoid U.S. tariffs. Apple, chipmaker Intel and footwear and apparel giant Nike are among U.S. corporations which bet on Vietnam as a production hub for goods often exported to the United States. Reuters • 12 hours ago Oil prices fall 2% to two-month low on worries about US tariffs Oil prices fell more than 2% to a two-month low on Tuesday on negative economic news from the U.S. and Germany, driven in part by worries about U.S. President Donald Trump's push for trade tariffs.

Yahoo Finance • 3 days ago ^IXIC ^GSPC India to cap investment in EV charging for tariff relief as Tesla entry looms, document shows India's EV policy, which offers import tax cuts for foreign automakers investing in the country, will restrict them from using funds spent on charging infrastructure for such relief, increasing their car manufacturing, a government document shows. India last year announced a policy aimed at attracting Tesla to manufacture EVs in the country and let such foreign carmakers import cars at a 15% tariff, from around 100% now, but only if they invest at least $500 million for a factory. But the policy will mandate that automakers can count only 5% of their total EV investment as coming from creation of charging infrastructure, even if they spend much more on the power network, according to government document detailing draft rules which is not public but was seen by Reuters.

While the home improvement retailer issued a cautious full-year outlook for 2025, it saw same-store sales grow by 0.8% and store foot traffic surge by 7.6% in the quarter. \"It's pretty clear, I think, from the call and from what we know about retailers in general, that companies want to sort of set a lower bar. That doesn't mean they're sandbagging it. January was a softer month than December, so they did see a little bit of a slowdown that plays into the guidance,\" D.A. Davidson managing director and senior research analyst Michael Baker tells the Catalysts team. Reacting to Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail's comments on interest rates, Baker explains to Seana Smith and Madison Mills that higher rates are \"a pressure point that's not getting any worse.\" The analyst also discusses what President Trump's tariffs could mean for Home Depot's business.

Upgrade Now What Feb. consumer confidence says about the labor market Seana Smith and Madison Mills Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 5:25 PM The preliminary Consumer Confidence Index reading shows that consumer confidence fell sharply to 98.3 in February , lower than the expected 102 and the prior reading of 104.1. The Conference Board senior US Economist Yelena Shulyatyeva joins Catalysts co-hosts Madison Mills and Seana Smith to discuss the factors driving this decline. Shulyatyeva acknowledges this was a \"sharp drop,\" with consumer confidence now at the lowest level of the range at which it has hovered for the last few years. However, she notes this number is still within a range that signals \"healthy consumer spending.\" Since this survey reflects labor market conditions, the sharp decline reveals that \"consumers are not seeing great prospects in the labor market, and that is something to watch in the months ahead.\" Shulyatyeva adds, \"If that continues to deteriorate, that's a big deal.\" She also highlights that consumers remain concerned about inflation, especially amid uncertainty around tariffs. With inflation remaining sticky and tariffs potentially proving inflationary, she notes this combination presents \"a big concern for the consumer.\" Related Videos 47:32 Palantir, navigating market uncertainty, layoff anxiety: Wealth Yahoo Finance Video • 21 hours ago 01:31 Not Worried Private Assets Are Being Mismarked: KKR's Sheldon Bloomberg • 20 hours ago 03:16 Earnings season: Nvidia will have to address DeepSeek worries Yahoo Finance Video • 19 hours ago 01:18 Home Depot earnings, Fed, consumer confidence: What to Watch Yahoo Finance Video • 16 hours ago To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here .

Upgrade Now BofA Strategist Hartnett Warns S&P 500 Rally Draws Investor Skepticism Sagarika Jaisinghani and Guy Johnson Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 12:15 PM 1 min read In This Article: ^GSPC -1.01% (Bloomberg) -- There’s growing “suspicion” among investors about the scope for more S&P 500 gains at a time when European and Chinese stocks are outperforming, according to Bank of America Corp. strategist Michael Hartnett. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump Targets $128 Billion California High-Speed Rail Project Trump Asserts Power Over NYC, Proclaims ‘Long Live the King’ NYC’s Congestion Pricing Pulls In $48.6 Million in First Month NYC to Shut Migrant Center in Former Hotel as Crisis Eases As Visitors Discover Ghent, the City Is Trying to Prevent a Tourism Takeover “The longer it takes and the harder it is for the S&P to get to new highs, the doubts grow,” Hartnett said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. “Europe’s working, China’s working, even bonds in America are starting to work.” The strategist has recommended international equities over US peers this year as he expects the so-called Magnificent Seven technology stocks to wobble after driving the US rally since the start of 2023. While he said investors are far from pessimistic about big tech, these stocks are vulnerable to declines if the trade “doesn’t keep working.” US stocks have trailed global peers this year as investors questioned lofty valuations and hefty spending on artificial intelligence. The S&P 500 is up less than 2% in 2025, while a basket of the Magnificent Seven stocks has fallen 3.3%. By contrast, the MSCI All-Country World Index excluding the US has rallied 7%. Hartnett said investors are likely to look for fiscal intervention from the Trump administration if the S&P 500 were to drop to 5,600-5,700 points — a decline of as much as 6% from current levels. “The stock market is his traffic light,” the strategist said, referring to US President Donald Trump. --With assistance from Bre Bradham.

Upgrade Now Apple plans $500 billion in US investment, 20,000 research jobs in next four years Stephen Nellis Mon, Feb 24, 2025, 12:07 PM 3 min read In This Article: AAPL +0.38% TSM -1.92% By Stephen Nellis (Reuters) -Apple said on Monday it would spend $500 billion in U.S. investments in the next four years that will include a giant factory in Texas for artificial intelligence servers and add about 20,000 research and development jobs across the country in that time. That $500 billion in expected spending includes everything from purchases from U.S. suppliers to U.S. filming of television shows and movies for its Apple TV+ service. The company declined to say how much of the figure it was already planning to spend with its U.S. supply base, which includes firms such as Corning that makes glass for iPhones in Kentucky. The move comes after media reports that Apple CEO Tim Cook met President Donald Trump last week. Many of Apple's products that are assembled in China could face 10% tariffs imposed by Trump earlier this month, though the iPhone maker had secured some waivers from China tariffs during the first Trump administration. \"This pledge represents a political gesture towards the Trump administration,\" said Gil Luria, analyst at D.A. Davidson, who estimated Apple has already committed to spend more than $150 billion per year in the United States, including cost of goods sold and capital expenditure. \"Even without growing that spend very much, they would only need 3 to 4 years to meet their obligation.\" Apple made a similar announcement about its U.S. spending plans in 2018, during the first Trump administration, when it said its new and ongoing investments would contribute $350 billion to the U.S. economy over five years. The company's shares were up 1.2%. Trump, in a Truth Social post, thanked Apple and Cook, saying the move reflected the company's faith in his administration. Most of Apple's consumer products are assembled outside the U.S., though many of Apple components are still made there, including chips from Broadcom, Skyworks Solutions and Qorvo. Apple said it last month started mass producing chips of its own design at an Arizona factory owned by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Bringing TSMC to Arizona and helping introduce legislation that later became the CHIPS Act to bolster U.S. semiconductor production were two of Trump's biggest industrial policy moves during his first term. Apple said on Monday it will work with Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, to build a 250,000-square-foot facility in Houston, where it will assemble servers that go into data centers to power Apple Intelligence, its suite of AI features that help draft emails and perform other tasks. Those servers are currently made outside of the U.S., Apple said. Story Continues Apple said it plans to increase its Advanced Manufacturing Fund from $5 billion to $10 billion, with part of the expansion being a \"multibillion-dollar commitment from Apple to produce advanced silicon\" at TSMC's Arizona factory. Apple did not disclose details of its deal with TSMC, but it has in the past used the fund to help partners build out the infrastructure needed to deliver products or services for Apple. Apple will also open a manufacturing academy in Michigan where its engineers, along with local university staff, will offer free courses for small and mid-sized manufacturing firms in areas such as project management and manufacturing process optimization.

Yahoo Personal Finance · Getty Images J Jess Ullrich Tue, Feb 18, 2025 4 min read If your personal file cabinet is overflowing with old tax records, credit card bills, or bank statements, you might be wondering what to keep and what to trash. When it comes to taxes especially, many people hesitate to toss important documents for fear of an IRS audit. It begs the question: How long should you keep tax documents? And are there any you should save indefinitely? Here’s how long to keep specific tax documents and how to properly dispose of them when the time comes. What tax documents do I need to keep? While it might be tempting to trash all your old tax forms after tax filing season, good recordkeeping is smart. You’ll want to retain the following documents for at least three years, but possibly longer — we’ll discuss specific time frames shortly. Tax returns W-2s 1099s from capital gains, dividends, self-employment earnings, or bank interest 1098s from mortgage interest deductions Additional supporting documentation for deductions and credits Supporting documentation for distributions from 529s, health savings accounts, or retirement accounts Supporting documentation for tax-deductible contributions to a retirement savings account, such as a traditional IRA Receipts for charitable donations Supporting documentation for the sale and purchase of assets in a taxable brokerage account Property tax assessments Mortgage documents, including your settlement statement Receipts for home improvements Why should I keep tax returns for three years? Under normal circumstances, the IRS recommends keeping your past tax records for three years from when you file or from the current year’s tax due date. That’s because if you're audited, you’ll typically need to provide copies of your federal tax returns from the past three tax years. This is the statute of limitations that the IRS applies in typical tax situations. But there are some exceptions to this three-year rule, especially if the IRS identifies a serious problem with your original return. In this case, the IRS can request additional tax returns. For instance, if you fail to report over 25% of your gross income on your taxes — even if it’s unintentional — the IRS can request up to six years of income tax returns. There’s no statute of limitations for taxpayers who file a fraudulent return or don’t file taxes at all. In those situations, the IRS can request as many years of tax returns as it deems necessary. The time frame for retaining state tax returns varies based on where you live. For instance, the state of California’s statute of limitations for a tax audit is four years, which means you’ll want to keep your tax returns for at least four years if you reside there.

Free tax filing: How to file your 2024 return for free Are there any tax documents I should keep longer? In addition to the uncommon tax scenarios mentioned, there are other situations when you may want to retain certain documents longer. If you file taxes in another country besides the United States, for example, you might qualify for a foreign tax credit on your U.S. returns. The IRS gives you up to 10 years to claim this credit, so you might need to keep related tax documents for up to a decade. If you’re an investor, you also have up to seven years to claim bad debt deductions for worthless securities. You might also decide to keep your W-2s indefinitely to help calculate future Social Security payments. You’ll want to keep any documents related to the purchase of your home for as long as you own it, including loan agreements and your settlement statement that itemizes your closing fees. These will be useful for calculating the taxes you’ll pay when you sell. A home sale could result in a hefty tax bill if your property has appreciated in value significantly since you bought it. The IRS looks at the difference in the initial purchase price of your home and its final sale price to help calculate your capital gains tax. But that’s not the only thing it considers; it also looks at the cost of any capital improvements you made to your home and other expenses such as any legal or recording fees you paid when you bought your property. Those amounts, minus depreciation, are your cost basis. And generally, the higher your cost basis, the lower your burden when you sell your house.

How to properly dispose of tax documents Burning and shredding are the best ways to dispose of old tax returns or other important documents. This ensures your personal and financial information remains private. Avoid putting tax returns or other personal documents in your trash or recycle bin as this could put you at risk of identity theft.

Upgrade Now Citadel Securities plots jump into crypto trading after Trump’s embrace Katherine Doherty and Sridhar Natarajan Mon, Feb 24, 2025, 5:43 PM 3 min read (Bloomberg) — Ken Griffin’s market-making giant Citadel Securities is looking to become a liquidity provider for cryptocurrencies, betting President Donald Trump’s embrace of the industry will usher in a boom for the asset class. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump Targets $128 Billion California High-Speed Rail Project Trump Asserts Power Over NYC, Proclaims ‘Long Live the King’ NYC’s Congestion Pricing Pulls In $48.6 Million in First Month NYC to Shut Migrant Center in Former Hotel as Crisis Eases As Visitors Discover Ghent, the City Is Trying to Prevent a Tourism Takeover It’s a clear pivot from the firm’s previously cautious stance on crypto market-making. Citadel Securities has had a limited presence in crypto trading, having steered clear of exchanges frequented by retail investors due to a lack of regulations around it in the US. The firm aims to get added to the roster of market makers on various exchanges, including those run by Coinbase Global Inc., Binance Holdings and Crypto.com, according to people familiar with the matter. Once the firm is approved on exchanges, it initially plans to set up market-making teams outside the US, the people said, asking not to be identified as the plans aren’t public. The extent of the push and Citadel’s desire could change based on how or if new regulations roll out in the coming months. Miami-based Citadel Securities didn’t have an immediate comment. Until now, Citadel Securities has stayed off major crypto venues frequented by retail traders. After the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX in 2022, crypto exchanges drew criticism for a failure to separate businesses — including custody, market-making and trading — that can result in conflicts of interest and in the manipulation of funds. To create some certainty and serve institutional clients, Citadel Securities teamed up with brokerage firms, including Charles Schwab and Fidelity Investments, to form an institution-only crypto exchange that mirrored the way assets are held and settled in stock and bond markets. That venue, EDX Markets, went live in 2023, and offers trading in crypto products only for institutional investors. Citadel Securities and other financial firms have been pushing for regulators to establish rules around investing in digital assets, creating a roadmap for institutions to get involved. If the US does that, the firm wants to be ready to provide liquidity, buying and selling digital assets like they do in other asset classes like equities and fixed income, the people said. ‘Crypto Capital’ The financial industry is gearing up for more activity in digital assets under the Trump administration. Story Continues As a candidate, Trump pledged to make the US the “crypto capital of the planet” and since taking power, he has sought to overhaul rules that chilled activity under President Joe Biden. Trump quickly issued an executive order on digital assets and the US Securities and Exchange Commission launched a task force on crypto headed by Hester Peirce, a longtime advocate for the industry. Citadel Securities has grown from a small group built alongside Griffin’s hedge fund into a global trading behemoth not only in US‑listed markets but also international ones, pushing into investment banks’ favored products under the leadership of Chief Executive Officer Peng Zhao. It’s a market maker in equities, options, corporate bonds, Treasuries and exchange-traded funds. But unlike its trading peers, the firm stayed away from crypto market-making. Jane Street Group, known for its dominance in markets such as ETFs and corporate bonds — which account for the majority of its business — has been executing crypto trades since 2017. Jump Crypto built out its own crypto unit to become one of the world’s top market-making firms for digital assets. But both of those firms pulled back from trading digital assets in the US amid a regulatory crackdown in 2023. A spate of crypto probes in the US prompted companies to look toward financial hubs overseas, including Dubai, Singapore and Hong Kong. Jump and Jane Street continued market making in crypto, though on a smaller scale, never abandoning the asset class entirely.

Upgrade Now US State Credit Quality Declines on ‘Destabilizing’ Trump Orders Erin Hudson Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 5:15 PM 1 min read (Bloomberg) -- The “rapid and chaotic activity” of the Trump administration is undermining the credit quality of US states, according to a new report from Municipal Market Analytics. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump Targets $128 Billion California High-Speed Rail Project Trump Asserts Power Over NYC, Proclaims ‘Long Live the King’ NYC’s Congestion Pricing Pulls In $48.6 Million in First Month NYC to Shut Migrant Center in Former Hotel as Crisis Eases As Visitors Discover Ghent, the City Is Trying to Prevent a Tourism Takeover MMA has lowered its state-sector outlook to neutral from positive, citing a bevy of White House executive orders and policies that have broad implications for federal funding and staffing. States rely on assistance from Washington for numerous programs including supporting public education and healthcare. The uncertainty created by real or threatened changes in federal funding raises the likelihood that states will tap their reserves and may cut or pause projects. That may reduce state aid to local governments, colleges or hospitals, the research firm said. States do have an “exceptional” levels of reserves, according to MMA. “The destabilizing actions of the federal government are a challenge to state credit quality,” Matt Fabian and Lisa Washburn of MMA wrote in the report. “State governments receive about one-third of their funding from the federal government and rely on such to provide essential services to their constituents.” MMA lowered its outlook for state housing finance agencies, also pointing to cuts to federal funding and staffing as increasing the risk of a negative action on the US government’s bond ratings. It also highlighted the looming threat that the administration could eliminate the muni market’s tax-exemption entirely, or in part. “States are also incurring increased costs from these actions in terms of distraction from normal government activities, increased costs for advisors and consultants to evaluate alternatives, and litigation costs related to challenging the federal government’s actions,” the researchers said.

Upgrade Now Oil Slumps to Lowest This Year as Economic Pessimism Piles Up Julia Fanzeres Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 5:16 PM 2 min read In This Article: DNKEY +3.34% DNSKF 0.00% (Bloomberg) -- Oil slumped along with equity markets as US consumer confidence tumbled, adding to mounting concerns that US President Donald Trump’s policies will hamper economic growth and sap energy demand. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump Targets $128 Billion California High-Speed Rail Project Trump Asserts Power Over NYC, Proclaims ‘Long Live the King’ NYC’s Congestion Pricing Pulls In $48.6 Million in First Month NYC to Shut Migrant Center in Former Hotel as Crisis Eases As Visitors Discover Ghent, the City Is Trying to Prevent a Tourism Takeover West Texas Intermediate fell as much as 2.6% to less than $69 a barrel, touching the lowest price this year. US consumer confidence dropped the most since 2021 and missed analysts’ estimates, prompting traders to flee risk assets, including equities. Trump’s tariffs and recent moves to further decouple economic ties with China, which spurred a drop in the Asian country’s stock markets Tuesday, are worsening the already-gloomy outlook for energy demand in the world’s largest oil consumer. Domestically, the trade turmoil is raising Americans’ inflation expectations amid a cooling labor market. “Crude markets are seeing another layer of bearish pressure from a continued string of misses in economic data,” said Frank Monkam, head of macro trading at Buffalo Bayou Commodities. “Such a rollover in economic data bodes ill for crude demand.” Crude has now broken below the roughly $5 range it had wandered in for February. Oil had initially spiked above $80 early this year before fading amid persistent expectations of lackluster Chinese demand, the potential for additional barrels on the market and the prospect that tariffs will weigh on global growth. Earlier this week, the US imposed more curbs on brokers, vessels and individuals that it said were linked to illicit shipments of Iranian crude. Markets had a muted reaction to the additional sanctions on expectations that the trade would adapt quickly by ramping up ship-to-ship transfers or switching off geo-locating signals for longer. The shifts would resemble Russia’s steps to keep crude exports flowing in the face of restrictions. “Sanctions are not the bullish factor many are expecting unless we see true attempts at locating and blockading tankers with naval forces — an unprecedented level of escalation,” said Joe DeLaura, a former trader and global energy strategist with Rabobank.

Upgrade Now Brazil Waterway Operator Extends Selloff On Drought Loss Gerson Freitas Jr. and Clarice Couto Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 5:20 PM 1 min read In This Article: AMZN -3.20% (Bloomberg) -- Hidrovias do Brasil SA, an operator of barges that transports soybeans and corn via the Amazon and its tributaries, extended a selloff to a sixth day after disclosing a loss driven by a severe drought. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump Targets $128 Billion California High-Speed Rail Project Trump Asserts Power Over NYC, Proclaims ‘Long Live the King’ NYC’s Congestion Pricing Pulls In $48.6 Million in First Month NYC to Shut Migrant Center in Former Hotel as Crisis Eases As Visitors Discover Ghent, the City Is Trying to Prevent a Tourism Takeover Shares of the Brazilian company plunged as much as 13% in Sao Paulo to the lowest level since March 2023 before trimming losses, bringing this year’s decline to nearly 30%. The grain and iron ore hauler saw fourth-quarter losses more than double from a year earlier due to a decline in transported volumes, it said in a Monday statement. Hidrovias do Brasil was one of the first companies to tap Amazon river tributaries for transportation of soybeans, opening up a new export route for Brazil’s booming harvests. It also operates in other riverways. But drier-than-normal conditions last year eroded navigation conditions, limiting its ability to move cargoes across the nation’s rivers. Sailing conditions on the Tapajos river, in the Amazon region, are expected to improve considerably in the second half of the year as local authorities are dredging the waterway, according to Chief Executive Officer Fabio Schettino. “We should not have problems anymore,” Schettino said during the call. Hidrovias do Brasil will soon announce the terms of a capital increase after scrapping a previously announced plan, the company said. The proceeds will be used to fund capacity expansion. The company’s debt has jumped to 6.6 times earnings before items such as interest and taxes, according to the statement. Its $398 million in notes due in 2031 are trading below 88 cents on the dollar.

Upgrade Now Bitcoin Slides Below $90,000 as Crypto Selloff Gathers Steam Suvashree Ghosh and David Pan Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 5:21 PM 4 min read In This Article: BTC-USD -8.04% ETH-USD -9.79% SOL-USD -6.95% (Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin tumbled below $90,000 to hit the lowest level since mid-November, as the rally that followed Donald Trump’s election to the White House reverses amid a broader retreat from risky assets. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump Targets $128 Billion California High-Speed Rail Project Trump Asserts Power Over NYC, Proclaims ‘Long Live the King’ NYC’s Congestion Pricing Pulls In $48.6 Million in First Month NYC to Shut Migrant Center in Former Hotel as Crisis Eases As Visitors Discover Ghent, the City Is Trying to Prevent a Tourism Takeover Bitcoin dropped as much as 8.5%, the biggest intraday declined since August. The largest cryptocurrency by market value was down 7.6% to $86,805 at 11:20 a.m. in New York on Tuesday. Other cryptocurrencies also fell, with Ether, XRP and Solana were mostly down more for the session. An index tracking top digital tokens was on pace for its largest four-day drop since early August. The recent turmoil in digital assets is a stark shift from the risk-on rally that drove crypto markets higher following Trump’s election in early November. Bitcoin has tumbled roughly 20% since his January inauguration, as Trump’s combative stance against allies and geopolitical rivals alike shakes investor confidence, and concerns about elevated inflation linger. “The fall in Bitcoin prices is likely related to broader macro uncertainty that has hit most financial markets in the last couple of days and is linked to the various tariffs being announced by President Trump,” said Adrian Przelozny, chief executive of crypto exchange Independent Reserve. Tumbling crypto prices mirror a broader retreat from risky assets that gained momentum late last week when a string of disappointing economic reports pushed the Nasdaq 100 to what is now its worst four-day drop since September. In turn, money has flowed into bond havens, pushing the 10-year Treasury yield down for five straight sessions. Exchange-traded fund investors, whose hand-over-fist buying helped power the post-election crypto advance, have been stepping back. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (ticker IBIT), the largest spot Bitcoin fund, shed $158 million on Monday in a rare outflow, while investors pulled nearly $250 million from the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund — the third-largest withdrawal among all ETFs. More than $956 million has exited from US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs in February, the worst month on record for the category, Bloomberg Intelligence data show. The bullish bets on crypto have seen hefty liquidations over the last two days with $815.8 million and $860 million respectively, according to data from Coinglass. Perpetual futures, which tends to be used by offshore investors due to its lack of availability in the US market, saw leveraged long positions drop. Story Continues “Perp traders showed an appetite to add BTC longs, but longs have largely been punished as BTC pushed to new yearly lows amidst substantial long liquidations,” said Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33 Research. “Aggressive positioning from offshore traders has created an environment ripe for continued volatility.” Memecoins, Giant Hack Sentiment has also soured following a series of recent industry-specific setbacks, including the biggest-ever crypto hack targeting exchange Bybit and a memecoin scandal involving Argentina’s President Javier Milei. That helps explain why digital coins have underperformed other risk assets like technology stocks in recent weeks. The Bybit hack, in particular, has added to fears about the safety of digital-asset platforms. Hackers which analysts say are linked to North Korea made off with about $1.5 billion of Ether in last week’s attack and have started quickly laundering the haul. Several researchers say the heist revealed a rising level of sophistication among North Korea’s army of hackers. Memecoins launched by Trump and his wife Melania just before the inauguration have also performed poorly, undermining confidence in his pro-crypto policies. The Trump token has tumbled more than 80% since peaking almost immediately after he launched it, based on CoinGecko data. “The Bybit hack was the latest in a string of events, such as questionable memecoin launches, that have brought back unhappy memories for crypto market participants,” said Caroline Mauron, co-founder of Orbit Markets, a provider of liquidity for crypto derivatives. Shares of crypto-related companies were also lower. Coinbase Global Inc. fell for a seventh day, and is down 29% over the period. Strategy lost around 20% over three days and is now in the red this year. Bitcoin miner MARA Holdings Inc. was down almost 10%, and is off 25% since December. --With assistance from Sidhartha Shukla, Katie Greifeld and Blaise Robinson.

Upgrade Now Exclusive-Head of Fed-watchdog task force in Congress plans broad U.S. central bank review FILE PHOTO: Federal Reserve Board Building in Washington · Reuters Howard Schneider Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 5:21 PM 2 min read By Howard Schneider WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a new congressional panel gearing up to strengthen Capitol Hill's oversight of the Federal Reserve plans a broad review of how the U.S. central bank makes its interest rate decisions, including whether controlling inflation should be prioritized over safeguarding employment. \"A substantial number of my Financial Services Committee colleagues and the chairman want to discuss that issue,\" Representative Frank Lucas, an Oklahoma Republican, told Reuters in an interview on Monday ahead of next week's first hearing of the Monetary Policy, Treasury Market Resilience, and Economic Prosperity Task Force. \"Is there really a dual mandate? And how does that affect the primary mandate of price stability?\" The Fed's dual mandate - to foster price stability and maximum employment - was imposed by Congress in 1978, and right now it is close to both goals: The unemployment rate is 4% and inflation has eased to 2.6% relative to a 2% target, a far better outcome than many feared. But the experience following the COVID-19 pandemic, with inflation surging to 40-year highs and the Fed scrambling to beat it with rapid rate hikes, has left scars. Lucas, a three-decade congressional veteran, is keen to explore whether the Fed's approach was flawed. Across a series of hearings in coming months, he will also look at longstanding issues like whether the Fed should make more use of monetary policy rules in its decisions, perhaps not to the full exclusion of its own discretion but as a way to give the public more certainty about the direction of policy. \"If your primary focus is price stability, and if you want the forces of the economy to be able to make decisions, then a more rules-focused process provides certainty to that,\" Lucas said. Lucas acknowledged the difficulty of amending the Federal Reserve Act given narrow Republican majorities in the House and Senate, and the nearly 50-year legacy of the dual mandate, but he expects his process potentially to lead to recommended legislation, a series of reports, or recommendations to the Fed. That is timely, he said, given the Fed is currently conducting its own review of an operating framework that in 2020 intensified its focus on joblessness - and which some argue slowed its response to price pressures that began building in 2021. \"These issues are relevant right now,\" he said. Along with monetary policy, the panel - composed of eight Republicans and six Democrats - will look at issues around the functioning of the U.S. Treasury market.

Upgrade Now Exclusive-Italy extends big tech tax probe to Musk's X social network Illustration shows 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and X logo · Reuters Emilio Parodi Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 5:26 PM 3 min read In This Article: META -3.13% By Emilio Parodi MILAN (Reuters) - Italy is claiming 12.5 million euros ($13 million) from Elon Musk's social network X following a tax probe running parallel to one into Meta, four sources with direct knowledge of the matter said, the latest move in a potential test case for the tech sector in Europe. While the value-added tax claim is a trifling sum for X, a company that generated $3.4 billion in revenue in 2023, the case is significant as it hinges on the way social networks provide access to their services. Italian tax authorities argue that user registrations with X, and Meta platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, could be seen as taxable transactions as they imply the exchange of a membership account in return for a user's personal data. If a judicial review upholds this interpretation, it would entail a change in the business model of the tech industry, extended to the 27-nation European Union since VAT is a harmonised EU tax. X did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The issue is particularly sensitive as U.S. President Donald Trump has raised the issue of imposing tariffs on imports from countries such as Italy that levy digital service taxes on U.S. tech companies. Musk also has a good working relationship with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and is keen to expand his Starlink communications business in the country. Italy extended its domestic tax on digital services to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in November to try to overcome U.S. objections that the levy is discriminatory. TAX AUDIT Milan's Guardia di Finanza (GDF) police closed a tax audit last April challenging X over non-payment of 12.5 million euros in VAT for the years 2016 to 2022, the four sources told Reuters. Musk completed his takeover of the formerly-named Twitter platform in October 2022. In January, Italy's Revenue Agency sent X a formal list of its own observations related only to the 2016 tax year, for which any action expires this year, fully endorsing the conclusions of the GDF investigation, the sources added. As has happened in previous such cases, Milan prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into X similar to one into Meta which completed an initial stage in December. The sources said that both Meta and X have until late March or early April to respond to the tax authority's observations, after which they will either accept its view and pay an agreed sum or initiate a fully-fledged judicial tax dispute. Italy has actively pursued tech companies over tax. Google last week agreed to pay 326 million euros to settle a tax claim relating to the period between 2015 and 2019. Story Continues Two of the sources, however, said that X and Meta were no longer interacting with the authorities because the case was not simply about agreeing a settlement figure but accepting a broader approach that would change the way business is done and how it is taxed. The two companies are awaiting a final decision by the Revenue Agency, they said. Italy's Revenue Agency, which reports directly to the Economy Ministry, will have two options if no agreement is reached: either drop its interpretation or initiate a full-blown judicial tax review. This latter procedure involves three different levels of judgment and in Italy has an average duration of about 10 years. That brings risks for the state, which could wait a decade and be left only with a handful of cash, and for companies, because from year to year the possible bill would rise if they lose.

Upgrade Now BofA CEO expects Fed to hold on rates, urges simpler regulation Saeed Azhar Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 4:37 PM 1 min read By Saeed Azhar (Reuters) - Bank of America ( BAC ) expects the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates steady this year and into next year, CEO Brian Moynihan said on Tuesday. \"It takes multiple years to squeeze inflation out,\" and the Fed's efforts to tame inflation will most likely last until 2026, Moynihan told a conference in Washington. Fed policymakers have kept rates unchanged as they seek to move inflation toward a 2% target. Moynihan also said simplifying U.S. bank regulations would be a good idea, echoing comments from other industry executives. \"Get us the rational regulatory structure and have it stick to the ribs,\" Moynihan said. \"If you keep swinging like this, our clients can't depend on us when they need us,\" Moynihan said, referring to shifting policies during successive presidential administrations. Bank of America and JPMorgan plan to lobby the White House and Congress to defend themselves from accusations by President Donald Trump and others that they have shut down conservative customers' accounts on political grounds. Trump's criticism echoed longstanding \"debanking\" complaints from Republicans, who have accused Wall Street banks of \"woke capitalism,\" as well as denying services to gunmakers, fossil-fuel companies and others perceived to be aligned with the political right. Moynihan called for more dialog about regulations on anti-money laundering, know-your-customer and reporting requirements. \"There's a lot of burden upon the banking system to both report suspicious activity and do a lot of analysis, and we have to close accounts - we can't tell people why we did,\" Moynihan said. \"It's about getting these regulations right.\" (Reporting by Saeed Azhar, editing by Lananh Nguyen and Nick Zieminski) View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard More Info Recommended Stories Copyright © 2025 Yahoo.

Upgrade Now Why stock market worries about tariff uncertainty might be a 'red herring': Morning Brief Myles Udland · Head of News Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 12:00 PM 3 min read This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings The stock market is trading near record highs, but the vibes feel off . Last week's sell-off brought out a laundry list of possible triggers, ranging from weak manufacturing data to rising inflation expectations to, of course, the impact of tariffs on consumers and across the economy. But according to Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macro, talk about the last item on that list simply covers up what the first two suggest: The US economy is slowing down. In an email on Monday, Dutta flagged four concerning developments for the economy that are largely the inverse of what led him to be among the leading voices on Wall Street arguing in favor of a \" no landing \" scenario back in 2022. The consumer is softening as income growth falls, housing is weak , government spending is slowing , and Wall Street expects the US economy to continue growing at around 2.5%, in line with each of the last three years. \"If 2023 was about being surprised to the upside, there is more risk in 2025 of being surprised to the downside,\" Dutta wrote. \"Much of what we see in the financial press — tariffs, uncertainty — is a red herring, an ex-post rationalization for an economic slowdown that was already in motion.\" Late last month, Fed Chair Jay Powell said the US economy was in \"quite a good place\" when outlining the Fed's rationale for pausing rate cuts. This assessment also helps explain why Powell seemed content not to push back on market expectations paring back their bets for further cuts. Asked about the impact of tariffs on the economy, Powell said \"significant\" shifts around tariffs, immigration policy, fiscal policy, and regulations each created \"additional uncertainty\" for the economic outlook. Still, the Fed chair appeared largely unbothered. In Dutta's view, however, the Fed's slowdown in rate cuts has created a \"passive tightening of monetary policy [that] is the dominant risk and that has important implications for financial market investors.\" In other words, by pausing rate cuts into a slowing economy, the Fed is de facto raising rates. Going forward, Dutta expects long-term rates and stocks to fall as rate cuts and an economic slowdown are priced in and the job market further slows. Whether it be tariffs, an overheated AI trade, or other pockets of froth in the stock market, the current market moment is not lacking for risks in the months ahead. Story Continues What's notable in Dutta's call is that he doesn't dredge up some obscure piece of alternative data the market hasn't yet priced in or outline an involved three-leg parlay of sentiment, valuations, and positioning. Rather, it looks at the basics: how much people get paid, how much it costs to live, and what the government is doing to help. And none of the trends are great.

Upgrade Now Home Depot posts revenue beat as home improvement challenges come into focus Brooke DiPalma · Senior Reporter Updated Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 1:03 PM 4 min read In This Article: LOW +2.05% HD +3.37% Home Depot's ( HD ) fourth quarter results slightly topped Wall Street's low expectations on Tuesday. In a slight improvement, the home improvement chain posted a 14.1% increase in revenue year over year to $39.7 billion. Adjusted earnings per share grew to $3.13, up from $2.86 last year and above estimates of $3.04. Home Depot has been struggling as shoppers held off on major renovation projects thanks to high interest rates and more cautious spending overall. That pressure is expected to continue; total net sales are expected to grow 2.8% in fiscal year 2025, while same-store sales growth is expected to increase by 1%. On the full-year outlook, CFO Richard McPhail told investors that Home Depot saw \"some benefits from hurricanes that won't fully repeat in 2025\" and that it assumes \"continued pressure on larger projects.\" Telsey Advisory Group's Joe Feldman wrote in a note to clients that the outlook was \"softer than expected,\" adding that the \"cautious approach in this uncertain environment makes sense and could prove conservative\" as consumers that have put off big projects over stubbornly higher mortgage rates , that executives say consumers will eventually \"get used to.\" Home Depot stock reversed early losses on Tuesday to gain more than 3.5% in afternoon trading.

Advanced Chart For the quarter, same-store sales growth rose 0.8%, whereas Wall Street had been looking for a drop of more than 1.71% to follow the previous eight straight quarters of negative growth. Regions affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton boosted sales growth by 60 basis points, while higher foot traffic, up 7.6%, and an uptick in the average ticket size, up 0.3%, also contributed. Feldman noted that pro categories such as roofing, drywall, and lumber also boosted results. E-commerce sales, which increased 9%, saw strength as well. The results exceeded company expectations with \"greater engagement in home improvement spend, despite ongoing pressure on large remodeling projects,\" Home Depot CEO Ted Decker said in the release.

The tariffs could increase costs, while any price hikes on retailers' end may affect consumer demand. \"We source well more than half of our goods domestically and in North America, but there certainly will be an impact,\" Decker said in the company's third quarter earnings call. This quarter, however, Decker said that the retailer is able to \"manage through any tariff environment, which would impact the industry broadly.\" He added that over the past six or seven years, Home Depot has diversified its supply chain. Correction: A previous version of this article listed the incorrect earnings figure. Home Depot's adjusted earnings per share figure was $3.13. We regret the error.

Upgrade Now Alcoa warns Trump's aluminum tariff could cost 100,000 US jobs Reuters Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 4:16 PM 2 min read (Reuters) -Aluminum producer Alcoa said on Tuesday that U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to impose a tariff on aluminum imports could cost about 100,000 U.S. jobs and would itself not be enough to entice it to boost production in the country. Trump earlier this month said he would impose a flat 25% tariff on aluminum imports \"without exceptions or exemptions\" in a bid to lift U.S. production of the metal used to make automobiles, cans and other products. The tariff takes effect on March 4. Pittsburgh-based Alcoa, which produces aluminum in Canada, Iceland, Australia and elsewhere, had trimmed its output in the United States in recent years partly due to electricity costs. Bill Oplinger, Alcoa's CEO, told the BMO Global Metals and Mining Conference in Florida that the tariffs could cost about 20,000 U.S. aluminum industry jobs and further 80,000 jobs in sectors that support it. \"This is bad for the aluminum industry in the U.S. It's bad for American workers,\" said Oplinger, an engineer by training who became CEO in 2023, in webcast remarks. U.S. data showed aluminum smelters produced just 670,000 metric tons of the metal last year, compared with 3.7 million in 2000. Plant closures in recent years, including in Kentucky and Missouri, have left the country largely reliant on imports. The tariffs alone would not be enough to entice Alcoa to restart some of its shuttered U.S. facilities, the CEO said, adding that Trump officials have asked the company to do just that. \"It's very hard to make an investment decision, even on something like a restart, without knowing how long the tariffs will last,\" Oplinger said. He also said that he has lobbied Trump officials for an exemption on Canadian aluminum imports. Alcoa would consider boosting U.S. output if it had cheap supply of power, which its Icelandic operations enjoyed, Oplinger said. Aluminum smelting consumes large amounts of electricity. Separately, Oplinger said he believed that any end to the conflict between Ukraine and Russia could see aluminum from Russia move into Europe. Oplinger also said he believed there were opportunities for the global aluminum market to consolidate, without providing details. Shares of Alcoa fell 2.6% to $34.10 in Tuesday morning trading.

Upgrade Now Nvidia, Cisco Extend Partnership Aimed at Speeding AI Adoption Ian King Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 1:40 PM 2 min read In This Article: NVDA -2.68% CSCO +1.19% (Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp., the top provider of chips used in new artificial intelligence computers, is extending a partnership with networking-gear maker Cisco Systems Inc. in a push aimed at making it easier for corporations to deploy AI systems. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump Targets $128 Billion California High-Speed Rail Project Trump Asserts Power Over NYC, Proclaims ‘Long Live the King’ NYC’s Congestion Pricing Pulls In $48.6 Million in First Month NYC to Shut Migrant Center in Former Hotel as Crisis Eases As Visitors Discover Ghent, the City Is Trying to Prevent a Tourism Takeover Many businesses remain in the early stages of adopting AI systems because of the complexity the shift adds to their data centers, Cisco and Nvidia said Tuesday in a joint statement. The two companies are broadening the list of products that include each others’ technology in an attempt to remove those hurdles. Nvidia offers networking add-ons to its AI server machinery, called Spectrum-X Ethernet. That product line will start including Cisco chips that handle broader connectivity functions, the two companies said. “Enterprises are under immense pressure to deploy AI quickly and effectively, and many leaders struggle to justify the investment while balancing the risks,” Cisco Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins said in the statement. “Together, Cisco and Nvidia are partnering to remove barriers for customers and ensure they can optimize their infrastructure investments to unlock the power of AI.” The build-out of AI data centers has been, for the most part, done by a small group of the world’s biggest companies — so-called hyperscalers like Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. that have vast engineering teams capable of designing and deploying machinery. Nvidia wants to broaden the technology’s reach beyond those few customers and push AI into the wider economy. It first teamed up with Cisco a year ago to try to reach that larger audience, including the corporations and government departments that are the networking company’s biggest users. For Cisco, which has struggled to sell its machinery into those hyperscalers’ data centers, the tie-up with Nvidia is a pathway toward grabbing a bigger slice of AI spending. Nvidia’s networking gear will include Cisco’s Silicon One chips, giving that product a boost against widely used products from Broadcom Inc.

Upgrade Now Treasury Yields Slide as Confidence Gauge Stokes Economy Fears Alice Atkins and Michael Mackenzie Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 5:15 PM 4 min read (Bloomberg) -- Treasury yields slid to their lowest levels of the year Tuesday as a gauge of consumer confidence joined a parade of evidence that US economy will require Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts this year. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump Targets $128 Billion California High-Speed Rail Project Trump Asserts Power Over NYC, Proclaims ‘Long Live the King’ NYC’s Congestion Pricing Pulls In $48.6 Million in First Month NYC to Shut Migrant Center in Former Hotel as Crisis Eases As Visitors Discover Ghent, the City Is Trying to Prevent a Tourism Takeover A bond market rally had already trimmed some Treasury yields by as much as 10 basis points before the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index fell more than expected to the lowest level since June. Yields declined to new session lows afterward, with all benchmark tenors falling at least 10 basis points. Traders resumed fully pricing in two quarter-point interest-rate cuts by the Fed this year even before the consumer confidence gauge, which is merely the latest sign that the US economy is struggling with inflation and borrowing costs. A Citigroup Inc. index of US economic surprises last week declined to the lowest level since September, indicating that data isn’t measuring up to expectations. Economic anxiety has also been stoked by declines in US stocks since the S&P 500 reached new record highs last week, with catalysts including a profit warning by Walmart Inc. Ongoing threats by US President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on imports from major trading partners and the slashing of federal payrolls are other contributors. “The 10-year will be sensitive to the data and if we do continue to see a little bit of a slowdown, then yields could grind lower,” said Gregory Faranello, head of US rates trading and strategy for AmeriVet Securities. “If the administration is going to cut spending and focus on initiatives that try and get the deficit down, then there is an element of austerity and of the economy slowing.” The 10-year has scope to reach 4.25%, its 200-day moving average, a widely followed trendline, Faranello said. A break below it “could get potentially a little grabby” as investors become concerned about missing a buying opportunity. Tuesday’s price action featured buying in 10-year Treasury options that anticipate a yield decline to around 4.15% by April 25. Bond bullishness also was reflected in JPMorgan’s weekly Treasury Client Survey, which found the biggest net long position since January. An auction of two-year notes on Monday drew strong demand despite a rally into the bidding deadline. Tuesday’s rally reduced the expected yield for new five-year notes in a $70 billion auction that closes at 1 p.m. New York time. In pre-auction trading, the notes traded at around 4.13%, down from a peak of 4.34% on the day the sale was announced last week. Story Continues Swaps that predict the outcome of future Fed rate decisions are pricing in 53 basis points of easing by the end of the year, up from 48 basis points on Monday. “Red flags are emerging for the US economy,” said Elias Haddad, senior market strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. “Another month or two of poor US economic data would deliver a blow to the US exceptionalism narrative.” What Bloomberg strategists say... “The narrative shifted on Monday, from ‘the new US administration isn’t yet delivering on our pro-growth expectations’ to ‘US policies may be starting to cause real economic damage.’ ... That’s why US 10-year yields are at their lowest level in more than two months and likely to head a chunk lower again over the coming weeks.” — Mark Cudmore, MLIV Executive Editor, Singapore. Read more here. The bond rally has driven 10-year yields to within 2 basis points of three-month bill yields, threatening to invert that part of the yield curve for the first time since mid-December. Historically, inversions have been a precursor of economic recessions, though the most recent period of inversion since late 2022 has not thus far. Bond traders also are contending with uncertainty about the Treasury supply outlook, which rests in part on Fed balance-sheet policy. The US central bank has been winding down its Treasury holdings, and traders have been anticipating it’s preparing to pause or slow down that process as the balance sheet approaches a certain size. Federal debt-ceiling considerations could influence the decision, the minutes of last month’s Fed policy meeting indicated. Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, speaking on that topic in London Tuesday, said it would be appropriate in the medium term for the Fed to purchase more shorter-term securities than longer-term ones so that its portfolio can more quickly mirror the composition of Treasury issuance, without commenting on the timing of any policy change. --With assistance from Ye Xie.

Upgrade Now Unforgiving math has Republicans asking for 'prayer' as they try to move forward on tax cuts Ben Werschkul · Washington Correspondent Updated Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 4:19 PM 6 min read House Republicans are trying to keep Donald Trump's push for \"one big beautiful bill\" alive this week with a budget resolution that will set the parameters of any deal. The challenge is making space for even a sliver of Trump's 17 different tax cut ideas. House Speaker Mike Johnson is facing microscopic margins, caught between deficit hawks on one side and nervous GOP moderates on the other. Both camps seemingly are ready to tank the effort even before it gets fully underway. \"This is a prayer request,\" Johnson even quipped on Monday. \"Just pray this through for us because it is very high stakes,\" he added of this week's effort even as he expressed confidence Republicans could get it done. \"I don't think anyone wants to be in front of this train. I think they want to be on it,\" he added. Underlying the problem for Johnson and his party is the unforgiving math — especially on the tax side of things — that has its roots in an array of promises from a freewheeling Trump. Yahoo Finance counted more than a dozen tax pledges from Trump before last November's election. A recounting in recent days has upped the tally to 17 different ideas, almost all of them cuts. Even the smallest estimates of Trump's varied tax promises put the tab at about $10 billion. The higher-side projections amount to much more: almost $18 trillion in new red ink over the coming decade. Meanwhile, Johnson and his colleagues are putting aside space for, at most, $4.5 trillion for tax cuts as part of an overall bill that would be paired with about $1.5 trillion in spending cuts. In addition to being nowhere close to enough to pay for Trump's tax ideas, the proposed cuts are also proving unpopular in their own right, as is the idea of potentially $3 billion in new red ink. \"The big question for me is whether the markets balk at that or not,\" Pangea Policy founder Terry Haines said in a recent episode of Yahoo Finance's Capitol Gains podcast of new deficit spending, adding, \"Once the degree of deficit increase becomes clear ... the markets are going to have a question to answer about whether they want to support this or not.\" Johnson is also already facing two public GOP \"no\" votes — Reps. Tim Burchett and Victoria Spartz, who say spending cuts need to be deeper. But other Republicans are making noise about joining them and voting no for the opposite reason, saying some of the harsher cuts — especially in healthcare — might need to be reversed. Democrats appear set to vote no en masse, calling the entire project a giveaway to the rich. Story Continues A tax plan left squeezed The math has left House Republicans with an allotment for tax cuts that may not even be enough to cross off the first item on Trump's list: extending the expiring provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. An analysis from the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) found that paying for that item alone could cost between $3.9 trillion and $4.8 trillion over the next decade. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt recently outlined Trump's eight top tax priorities. They included extending that 2017 law, providing relief on state and local taxes (SALT), no taxes on tips or overtime pay or Social Security benefits, cuts in the corporate tax rate for domestic production, closing the so-called carried interest loophole , and reducing tax benefits for sports stadium owners. The total tab for those ideas — even with the last two items on Trump's list representing tax increases — comes to somewhere between $5 trillion and $11.2 trillion, according to the CRFB . Speaker of the House Mike Johnson speaks with reporters at the US Capitol on Feb. 24. (Kent Nishimura/Getty Images) · Kent Nishimura via Getty Images And that's without a host of other ideas that Trump expounded on the campaign trail but has downplayed more recently. Such ideas — many of which remain popular in powerful corners of Capitol Hill — range from making car loan interest fully deductible to a new tax credit for family caregivers to a further expansion of the child tax credit. The total tab is somewhere between $10-18 trillion in impact to the federal budget over the coming decade, according to estimates from both the CRFB and from the Yale Budget lab. That means hard decisions — or some seriously fuzzy math — is in the offing as Republicans search for a way to fulfill perhaps their central 2024 promise in a world of $36 trillion national debt. 'We're about to enter a period of substantially more uncertainty' But even the initial efforts to pay for it have left some moderate Republicans wary. The budget blueprint set to be voted on this week has signaled that Medicaid could be in for $880 billion in cuts to the government healthcare program for low-income individuals and families. That puts at risk a program that is heavily relied on by voters, even in Republican districts. It's why Johnson and other Republican leaders are currently at risk of losing the vote of moderate figures such as Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey , among others. An analysis from the left-leaning Center for American Progress found that Drew's district alone could lose up to $2.18 billion in Medicaid funding if the cuts go through, potentially jeopardizing healthcare for 50,000 of his voters. President Donald Trump listens to a question during a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House in Washington on Feb. 24. (LUDOVIC MARIN/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) · LUDOVIC MARIN via Getty Images Republicans also face a political imperative to find a path to some sort of deal after making tax cuts a signature 2024 campaign issue and major provisions of the 2017 law set to expire at the end of the year in what Republicans like to call potentially the biggest tax increase in history if no action is taken. Haines currently pegs the odds of some sort of tax deal this year at 80% and predicts that ideas like no tax on tips (\"the oldest ask from Trump\") and increasing the SALT cap must be included in the bill because of their fierce political support. The bill is \"moving about as quickly as Washington can move,\" he said, noting that it could be a bumpy ride for markets in the short term, saying, \"We're about to enter a period of substantially more uncertainty.\" Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.

Upgrade Now Consumer confidence plunges most in nearly 4 years as inflation fears escalate on Trump tariff threats Alexandra Canal · Senior Reporter Updated Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 5:08 PM 3 min read In This Article: ^DJI -0.18% ^GSPC -0.97% ^IXIC -1.78% Consumer confidence declined sharply in February, notching its biggest monthly decline in nearly four years as uncertainty related to Trump's trade policy also lifted inflation expectations, according to new data released Tuesday morning . The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for February came in at a reading of 98.3, a significant drop from January's revised 105 reading and short of the 102.5 reading expected by economists. Read more: From $5 eggs to insurance premiums, here's where prices are rising “In February, consumer confidence registered the largest monthly decline since August 2021,” Stephanie Guichard, senior economist at the Conference Board, said in a press release. “This is the third consecutive month-on-month decline, bringing the Index to the bottom of the range that has prevailed since 2022.\" The \"Present Situation Index,\" which measures consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, fell to 136.5 in February from 139 in January. The \"Expectations Index,\" which tracks consumers' short-term outlook for income, business, and labor market conditions, also fell to 72.9 in February from 82 last month. Historically, a reading below 80 in that category signals a recession in the coming year. This was the first time since June 2024 that the index came in below that threshold. Meanwhile, average 12-month inflation expectations jumped from 5.2% last month to 6% in February, echoing other recent data points that highlight greater concerns around tariff uncertainty and the impact those policies could have on inflation. \"This increase likely reflected a mix of factors, including sticky inflation but also the recent jump in prices of key household staples like eggs and the expected impact of tariffs,\" Guichard said. \"There was a sharp increase in the mentions of trade and tariffs, back to a level unseen since 2019. Most notably, comments on the current Administration and its policies dominated the responses.\" President Donald Trump departs after speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference, CPAC, at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center, Saturday, Feb. 22, 2025, in Oxon Hill, Md. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) · ASSOCIATED PRESS President Donald Trump's revived tariff threats have weighed on sentiment as the administration doubles down on 25% across-the-board tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which are set to come next month. 10% duties on China have already been implemented. Earlier in February, Trump announced global 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports that are expected to take effect on March 12. Trump later ordered that federal agencies study reciprocal tariffs on trading partners. More recently, Trump said to expect additional duties on autos , chips, and pharmaceuticals. A flat tariff \"in the neighborhood of 25%\" would apply to all foreign automakers and start as soon as April 2. Story Continues \"Everybody is talking about inflation rising on the back of tariffs and that is a great concern for the consumer,\" Yelena Shulyatyeva, senior US economist at the Conference Board, told Yahoo Finance in an interview following the data's release. Notably, February's decline was broad-based among income groups, including the more affluent cohort of consumers, which has driven the bulk of spending in recent years. \"That is a concern,\" Shulyatyeva said. \"We know that consumer spending has been in large part driven by those at the top of the income spectrum. ... If this is going to slow down significantly, that's a concern for the economy.\" Eugenio Aleman, chief economist at Raymond James, wrote it's still \"up in the air\" whether or not this lack of confidence will translate to weaker economic growth.

AI spend key areas for Q4 results Nvidia's (NVDA) upcoming fourth quarter results — due out next Friday, February 28 — are expected to be pivotal, as the company begins shipping its new Blackwell AIchips. Francisco Bido, senior portfolio manager at FM Investments, joins Catalysts to point out that the demand for the new Blackwell chips will be a critical indicator of Nvidia's performance. \"I'll be paying lots of attention to the demand for the new Blackwell chips. That's one thing. And, I'm also interested in seeing if they're willing to discuss how foreign governments and US government is going to increase their spending in AI if they have any hints where that's going,\" Bido says. Regarding the development of Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) platform DeepSeek, Bido believes it will benefit the AI industry by expanding its user base. \"DeepSeek is basically a good thing for the AI industry. It's a way of making it widely available to many other potential users, and, if anything, it just widens the ecosystem and accelerates the early adoption of AI,\" he says. On market volatility, Bido anticipates disruption from uncertainty around tariffs. \"It's not so much whether they get implemented or not. It's just the threat of having them... that forces the people on the other side or the countries on the other side to think about diversification regardless if they're getting implemented or not,\" Bido explains.

To discuss what options markets are predicting ahead of the tech giant's results, BayCrest managing director of equity derivatives David Boole joins Morning Brief. According to Boole, options markets anticipate approximately 7% stock price volatility following the announcement — a moderate projection compared to recent quarters. This suggests that Nvidia's quarterly results report, while still significant, matters \"a little bit less than it used to,\" Boole explains. Though a 7% movement would translate to roughly $240 billion in market capitalization fluctuation, Boole points out this is only 2.5 times Nvidia's typical daily volatility. \"It's a big event, but I'm starting to think that it might not be a one-day surge like it used to,\" he tells Yahoo Finance, while acknowledging the results will likely \"set the stage\" for the stock's trajectory in the following month.

Simply put, an option is a contract between a buyer and a seller. “The buyer is paying a premium for the rights to execute upon that contract. The seller receives that premium,’ explains Inskip. Blikre and Inskip break down the key components of an option into four parts: quantity—one contract typically represents 100 shares; product—the security being traded; strike price—the agreed-upon price; and timeframe—the expiration date. When considering calls and puts, it’s important to remember, “Anytime you hear the word long, just like with stock, we think purchased. Short, we think sold. Call, the right to buy. Put, the right to sell,” says Inskip.

So this stock can go to zero overnight, but all they're [going to] lose is the premium they paid for that call.” The video also shares McLaughlin’s common strategies and tips for managing volatility in the options market.

Crossmark Global Investments chief market strategist Victoria Fernandez joins Morning Brief with Seana Smith and Brad Smith to discuss why the current market requires investors to be careful in deciding where to put their money. The strategist says the market's resiliency despite looming uncertainties is \"justified to an extent\" as \"there's probably a little bit more room to go here.\" She explains, \"We know 70% of our economy is driven by the consumer, and the consumer continues to spend. We've seen that in the consumption numbers.\" \"Is there a little bit more room to run here because earnings are still supportive? Yes. But are we seeing things telling us the economy is going to slow down? Yes, we are seeing that as well. So I think you do have to be cautious in where you put your money to work,\" Fernandez adds. She notes that Walmart's (WMT) earnings report, which sent the stock lower on a weaker-than-expected outlook, demonstrates this sentiment. \"There's going to be sectors that continue to do well and have support ... [but] we have to wonder if the earnings we've been seeing this quarter are pulled ahead because of tariffs and other elements that people anticipate over the coming quarters.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.

Chen identifies Walmart as a retail sector leader, noting the company \"executes so well\" across supply chain, curbside pickup, delivery, and AI implementation. \"It's really hard for everybody to do this\" at Walmart's scale and efficiency, Chen says. \"This company is consistent, and the consumer is consistent, so it's [Walmart] well positioned for a beat-and-raise,\" he explains. On investment potential, Chen affirms that \"we certainly like it for the longer term.\" He elaborates: \"What we are thinking is that there's a real barbell opportunity, meaning... these retailers that can execute to exceptional value, low prices, rollbacks, they will be better positioned because customers will trade down to places like Walmart to get that everyday low price. And that's great across all cohorts.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief&nbsp;here.

Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi chats with Bausch + Lomb chairman and CEO Brent Saunders. Saunders is known as one of the biggest dealmakers in the pharmaceutical industry of the past 15 years. Saunders returned to Bausch + Lomb as CEO in March 2023. In May 2013, he was also the CEO of Bausch + Lomb, responsible for its $8.7 billion sale to Valeant Pharmaceuticals. He then took over as the CEO of Forest Laboratories. By February 2014, Saunders orchestrated a sale of the company to Actavis for $25 billion. He assumed the CEO position. From there in November 2014, he pulled off a $70 billion acquisition of Allergan and became its CEO. It's there where Saunders' star quickly rose in media circles, overseeing the commercial success of botox and doing battle with feared activist investor Carl Icahn. Saunders then sold Allergan to Abbvie (ABBV) for $63 billion in a deal that closed in May 2020. He says no deal is imminent for Bausch + Lombb.

The iPhone developer is reportedly partnering with Alibaba (BABA) to further expands its artificial intelligence (AI) strategy, according to a report by The Information. TECHnalysis Research president Bob O'Donnell discusses on Asking for a Trend how the iPhone SE, with its smaller form factor and lower price, appeals to customers who prefer compact devices. \"The [iPhone] SE has never been a huge part of the iPhone market in terms of a percentage, but there is a very distinct group of people who just don't really like huge phones. And, the SE has served that market,\" O'Donnell says. While the SE may not drive massive sales, it serves a niche market, particularly in emerging regions where its affordability is key. O'Donnell comments on Apple's new AI partnership with Alibaba as the tech giant seeks to further penetrate China's consumer tech market: \"This is something that we knew had to be coming, not necessarily with Alibaba. But in order for Apple to bring Apple intelligence to China they were going to have to find a Chinese partner, and it's well known that Chinese consumers are very interested in AI capabilities.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trend&nbsp;here.

As Trump and his team work to establish new tariffs against foreign nations like Canada, China, and Mexico, everything is different from his first administration. On this week’s episode of Capitol Gains, Washington Correspondent Ben Werschkul breaks down the three main reasons why Trump’s latest tariffs are different from when he was in office during his first term. Werschkul attributes the differences to three main things: Trump is different The world is different Americans are different With Trump, he’s changed his approach to tariffs from his first administration. During Trump’s first term, tariffs were more focused on specific duties. This time around tariffs are bigger and blanketed, as we are seeing with his 10% tariffs on all imported goods from China. Werschkul says the tariffs are different because the world is different due to foreign nations learning Trump’s playbook during his first term. “They had years to plan for their retaliations,” Werschkul explains. We saw a lot of really novel approaches to response here that I think will change the back and forth [negotiations] here.” The third change to tariffs are the American people. American consumers are focused in on prices right now. “Inflation wasn’t at the top of mind six years ago,” Werschkul says. “Any changes we see here in prices are going to be noted on by Americans, which the White House will be watching for certain.” To learn more, listen to the full episode of Capitol Gains here.

Yahoo Finance Video • 21 days ago NVDA MSFT MicroStrategy history: Beyond the Ticker MicroStrategy (MSTR) and its chairman, Michael Saylor, are practically synonymous with bitcoin (BTC-USD) these days, but the business intelligence company has been around since 1989. Beyond the Ticker takes a deep dive into the company’s biggest moments. 1989 Back then, it was all about data analytics, and Saylor – fresh out of MIT – was a rising tech star. 1998 With the dot-com boom well underway, MicroStrategy went public under the familiar MSTR ticker at $12 per share. It rocketed to $333 as the dot-com boom peaked. Saylor became a paper billionaire practically overnight and wasn’t afraid to spend his wealth on legendary parties and a yacht, capturing the flashy spirit of the era. 2000 But when the dot-com bubble burst, MicroStrategy’s stock plummeted to just 42 cents, a stunning 99.9% drop. The company had to restate its financials, and the SEC slapped the company with fines. Still, Saylor held on, shifting MicroStrategy’s focus back to enterprise software and slowly dug the company out of its hole. 2010 MicroStrategy was moving into mobile analytics, and Saylor wrote a prescient book about the coming smartphone revolution called, “The Mobile Wave.” 2014 Facing stiff competition, MicroStrategy laid off more than 700 workers, and Saylor cut his own salary to just one dollar. 2020 The pandemic, however, would bring new opportunities. Saylor pivoted MicroStrategy again – this time into bitcoin – arguing that it was a better store of value than cash. 2024 He poured billions of corporate dollars into it. And today, MicroStrategy holds around 439,000 bitcoin with an average purchase price just over $60,000. With bitcoin trading around $100,000 per coin, MicroStrategy’s crypto stash is worth $44 billion. Investors, however, are placing a significant premium on the company, pushing its market capitalization to $89 billion – enough to secure its admission to the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) on December 23, replacing Super Micro Computer (SMCI.NE).

Filmore describes it as \"a milestone to see these two products at such large AUM [assets under management] levels,\" emphasizing that SPY \"arguably has the best liquidity in the market\" and is more suitable for active traders. He points out that VOO's lower fees make it potentially more attractive for long-term investors: \"So if you're a buy-and-hold investor, VOO might be more favorable.\" However, Filmore maintains that both products are \"very healthy.\" Addressing YouTuber Kevin Paffrath's recent closure of his ETF (PP), which held approximately $32 million in assets, Filmore acknowledges that \"it was a good example of innovation in the market,\" though he emphasizes that \"it comes down to education\" for investors considering these types of investment vehicles.

Amid the media giant's shift from linear networks to streaming, Johnston notes, \"The linear networks in streaming are in many ways two sides of a coin because a lot of the content that we produce actually winds up in both locations. So, in many ways, we've kind of perfectly hedged the business.\" \"So much of what we do is integrated in so many ways,\" the CFO explains. \"Given we have almost 180 million subscribers, we've really achieved a level where the streaming business is a terrific business unto itself, and because of the integration with linear, I think we can make it better than what other people can because we can produce content that cuts across both distribution channels.\" Netflix (NFLX) has staked its claim as an early streaming giant. The company reported better-than-expected results and raised its 2025 outlook. Johnston says, \"Netflix obviously had a big quarter in terms of content, both with some of the sports activities and some distribution deals they had done outside the US, but from our perspective, we're managing the business in a way where we're trying to grow subs, and we're trying to improve margins at the same time, and we're very much on track — in fact, if anything, slightly ahead — in terms of achieving both of those goals.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more \"Morning Brief\" here.

The startup claims to offer a more cost-effective alternative to established chatbots from Silicon Valley's tech giants. Director of Cornell University's Tech Policy Institute, Sarah Kreps, joins Catalysts to share her thoughts on this new technology. Kreps contextualizes DeepSeek's emergence against recent major AI announcements, including the Trump administration's $500 billion Stargate AI initiative and Meta Platforms's (META) $65 billion AI commitment. \"It was so interesting to follow that, at a 5% or a fraction of what these Big Tech companies are spending, it looks like this small Chinese startup is able to perform in many of the same ways as these American pioneers,\" she tells Yahoo Finance. According to Kreps, DeepSeek places \"enormous pressure\" on US AI companies to showcase tangible value from their investments. She expects \"ripple effects,\" as this development will challenge companies to \"raise the bar\" for AI technology. Looking ahead, Kreps predicts \"a bifurcation within the market,\" noting that \"not every company can afford OpenAI's services; they might prefer these alternatives that are a fraction of the price.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts&nbsp;here.

This announcement triggered a notable sell-off among major tech stocks. Futurum Group CEO Dan Newman and Bernstein managing director and senior analyst Stacy Rasgon share their insights on Morning Brief. Rasgon feels minimally concerned about the situation. He notes, \"The models they've built are fantastic, they really are ... but what they're doing is not miraculous either or unknown to any of the other top-tier AI researchers or AI labs that are out there.\" While recognizing the market's \"panic,\" Rasgon characterizes the stock decline as \"overblown,\" stating, \"I don't think DeepSeek is doomsday for AI infrastructure.\" Newman echoes Rasgon's skepticism, raising questions about the announcement's credibility. \"When did we decide that we're going to just believe a paper that comes out of China?\" he says. Newman suggests the claims require verification, noting that \"it's not unlike China to potentially try and play a little bit of psyops with Americans and the markets to see how we would react.\" However, Newman also acknowledges that if DeepSeek's claims are \"accurate,\" affordable AI models could benefit the entire sector. \"I just think the market's completely missing this one, and the fact that we're believing China just with their word, to me, I think that needs a little more inspection,\" he adds.

Sankey Research lead analyst Paul Sankey sits down with Madison Mills and Seana Smith on Catalysts to examine the energy sector as investors try to gauge the impact of Trump 2.0. \"It's definitely disconcerting that [the Trump administration keeps] talking about lower oil prices,\" Sankey says. He notes there's a \"directly opposing internal inconsistency\" within Trump's rhetoric on energy. Sankey explains, \"There's a very specific concern about pump gasoline prices, and then at the same time, you've got things like the tariff threat from Canada ... our biggest oil supplier, oil that we also can't replace.\" He adds, \"They want lower prices, but a lot of what they're saying and doing would mean higher prices.\" Looking ahead, the analyst notes that natural gas is positioned well for success given the amount of spending going into artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure which \"obviously, is going to need an absolutely enormous amount of US electricity, and that becomes US natural gas.\" There is growing uncertainty about President Trump's future tariff policy, as the president has seemingly backed away from his harsh pre-inauguration tariff rhetoric.

Elizabeth O’Brien, Vice President of the US Chamber Foundation’s Hiring Our Heroes program, dissects the many causes and effects of the issue on a new episode of Yahoo Finance’s Warrior Money podcast, co-hosted by Patrick Murphy and Dan Kunze. As Kunze notes during their conversation, it’s often said that it takes two years for an individual to feel at home in a new place. When a military spouse is forced to move every few years, that process can become an unending cycle. “The sooner we can build networks and social capital for military families as they move to new communities, the better,” O’Brien says. “We have the same challenges that so many of our American families have: access to safe, affordable childcare; re-entry to the workforce. Our challenges aren’t unique only to us,” she explains. “But there are solutions that we can create for our military families that then benefit America writ large.” One’s ability to serve in the military is often dependent upon the financial stability of their household. When military spouses cannot find employment, the armed forces themselves may see a lower turnout. Thus, the economic well-being of military spouses can have a ripple effect on the rest of the country, such as “keeping our infrastructure sound, keeping us competitive on the global economy, and impacts to national security,” O’Brien explains. “If I didn’t have the opportunity to go to work, [my husband] wouldn’t be a colonel in the Army right now,” she adds. O’Brien discusses what solutions are available to military spouses and what more needs to be done in her full conversation with Murphy and Kunze. Hosted by former Congressman Patrick Murphy and veteran investor Dan Kunze, Yahoo Finance’s&nbsp;Warrior Money&nbsp;is a weekly vodcast dedicated to uplifting military veterans transitioning into civilian life. Through insights from fellow veterans and high-ranking government officials, Murphy and Kunze are helping set vets up for success through financial education and inspiration.

Daily 9:00AM - 10:00AM ET Featured Krispy Kreme aims for long-term growth through US partners: CEO Krispy Kreme's (DNUT) recent struggles were evident as the company missed Wall Street expectations in its fourth quarter, with a 10% drop in revenue from last year. Krispy Kreme stock plunges by over 20% Tuesday morning as it also issued weaker-than-expected guidance. Krispy Kreme CEO Josh Charlesworth joins Morning Brief to discuss the company's strategy moving forward with Seana Smith, Brad Smith, and Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Brooke DiPalma. “This morning, we did report our 18th consecutive organic growth quarter... that was actually in line with our expectations, excluding the very disruptive cyber incident we had last year,\" Charlesworth says, referencing a cyberattack that targeted the chain in November 2024 and impacted online ordering. He emphasizes the company's efforts to transform Krispy Kreme into a larger, more successful brand. \"Our core strategy is working, which is to get those awesome, fresh donuts out to more people. And, we really focused on the milestones we achieved in 2024 and 2025 to do that in the US through national distribution partners and internationally with franchise partners,\" the CEO adds, voicing an aim for sustainable, long-term expansion.

The Conference Board senior US Economist Yelena Shulyatyeva joins Catalysts co-hosts Madison Mills&nbsp;and Seana Smith to discuss the factors driving this decline. Shulyatyeva acknowledges this was a \"sharp drop,\" with consumer confidence now at the lowest level of the range at which it has hovered for the last few years. However, she notes this number is still within a range that signals \"healthy consumer spending.\" Since this survey reflects labor market conditions, the sharp decline reveals that \"consumers are not seeing great prospects in the labor market, and that is something to watch in the months ahead.\" Shulyatyeva adds, \"If that continues to deteriorate, that's a big deal.\" She also highlights that consumers remain concerned about inflation, especially amid uncertainty around tariffs. With inflation remaining sticky and tariffs potentially proving inflationary, she notes this combination presents \"a big concern for the consumer.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts&nbsp;here.

The amount you pay as a down payment can influence your mortgage interest rate. Generally, larger down payments result in lower interest rates, as lenders see these as a sign of strong financial commitment. Loan term Loan Term: This refers to the duration over which you will repay your loan, typically measured in years. Opting for a longer loan term can reduce your monthly payments by spreading them out over a greater number of years, whereas shorter loan terms generally lead to higher monthly payments. 30-year fixed 30-year fixed 15-year fixed 5-year ARM Interest rate Interest Rate: This is the annual cost you incur for borrowing money, expressed as a percentage of the loan amount. It represents the fee you pay each year to the lender for your loan. Data is provided as-is via the Zillow Mortgage API © Zillow, Inc., 2024. Use is subject to the Zillow Terms of Use.

The purchase price of the house, the down payment, the monthly payment — all big numbers. A mortgage calculator helps you make sense of what can be abstract. Using it allows you to consider all the factors that can impact home affordability, quality of life, and wealth accumulation. Not to mention helping you achieve peace of mind with what might be a bit mind-boggling. Here's how to think through the calculations step by step. Learn more: Everything you should know as a first-time home buyer How to use the Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator Just four data points will get you started: Home price Easy enough, this is the price you'll pay for the home you're considering. When it comes time to make the deal, the price may be a point of negotiation. Here, you can start with a price that buys you all the amenities you could possibly want — and then work down from there to achieve a real-life monthly payment you can afford.

How much is the monthly payment on a $300,000 mortgage? What is the monthly payment on a $200,000 mortgage? Down payment The down payment is another number that might begin as a moving target. You might put in a number that's the bare minimum, say a 3% down payment, and then work your way up from there. If you are a military-connected borrower using a no-down-payment-required VA loan or a low-income buyer in a rural area eligible for a USDA loan, you may even have earned the right to put a zero here. Learn more: How much down payment do you need for a house? Loan term A loan term is the number of years you expect to pay off the loan. You'll see that a 30-year fixed-rate loan is the default here. Don't let that stop you from investigating the monthly payment of a 15-year loan or one with an even shorter term. Quicker paybacks result in paying less interest and gaining value, or equity , in your home faster. Learn more: 15-year vs. 30-year mortgage — Which is better? Interest rate You can take a look at the lender offers above to fine-tune your mortgage interest rate, but for now, put in a rate that you believe you'll qualify for. It's a good idea to resist the temptation to be overly optimistic here. It feels much better to qualify for a lower mortgage rate than you expected rather than the other way around. Dig deeper: How to get the lowest mortgage rate possible What is included in a typical mortgage payment Now that you've filled in the basics, the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator reveals your estimated monthly payment with principal and interest estimates built in. Here are typical costs often included in your monthly mortgage payment. Mortgage principal : The amount you owe on the loan. This is estimated for you. Mortgage interest : The interest you pay to borrow the money. This is included with the principal estimate. Homeowners insurance : An estimated monthly cost for the insurance premium you'll pay to protect your home in case of damage. Property taxes : The taxes you'll pay on your home and land. This is not estimated, but you can click on the dropdown link to add it to your estimated payment if you have an idea of how much it costs. Private mortgage insurance : If you put down less than 20% on a conventional loan, the lender will charge you PMI. You can put an estimate of that in the dropdown as well. HOA fees : Some neighborhoods charge homeowners' association fees to pay for maintenance and improvements on shared spaces. You can add that to your monthly payment calculation. Tip: Other costs of homeownership are not built into the loan payment, including: utilities, maintenance, repairs, and upgrades. Read more: PITI (principal, interest, taxes, insurance) and how it affects your mortgage payment The monthly payment breakdown In the middle of the payment calculator is a pie chart showing a graphic breakdown of the main components of your monthly payment: principal and interest in blue, a property tax estimate in yellow, and the estimated homeowners' monthly insurance premium in teal. Learn more: How much house can I afford? Use Yahoo Finance's home affordability calculator. The mortgage payment formula The Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator does the work for you, but for those who wish to look under the hood, here is the actual calculation: Mortgage payment formula · Brent Sanchez A is the monthly mortgage payment (in dollars) P is the principal amount of the loan (the amount you borrow) r is the monthly interest rate (as a decimal) n is the total number of payments over the life of the loan Here's how to use the formula: Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly interest rate: Divide the annual interest rate by 12. For example, if your annual interest rate is 5%, your monthly interest rate would be 0.05 / 12 = 0.004167. Calculate the total number of payments: Multiply the number of years in your loan term by 12 (i.e. 12 months of the year). For example, a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage would have 30 years x 12 months = 360 payments. Put the values into the formula: Once you have the monthly interest rate and the total number of payments, you can plug them in along with the home loan amount (P) into the formula to calculate the estimated monthly mortgage payment. Remember, this is an estimate from a manual calculation. The actual payment may vary depending on factors such as private mortgage insurance and property taxes, which are included in the Yahoo Finance calculator but are still only estimates. Learn more: What is mortgage insurance, and how much does it cost? Why use a mortgage calculator? Taking a mortgage payment calculator for a spin can be an interesting exercise. But there are some serious decisions it can help guide, as well. For example: To determine the mortgage that's best for you When shopping for a mortgage loan, you can compare the interest rates offered by different mortgage lenders by entering them into the calculator and seeing how a slight improvement in your rate can impact your monthly payment. Perhaps more importantly, you can get a feel for just how much interest you'll save over the life of a home loan. Read more: Best mortgage lenders for first-time buyers To consider different loan terms A 30-year mortgage loan has traditionally been the standard loan term, but many other options exist. A shorter term will pay off the loan faster and set you on the path to greater wealth accumulation. That's important if you want to shorten the runway to your life after work. You can also compare a fixed-interest-loan rate with an ARM's introductory rate. Adjustable-rate mortgages can be appropriate for home buyers who expect to move before the five- or 10-year introductory rate period ends. Learn more: Adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgage To evaluate your down payment A mortgage calculator can also provide a real-life comparison of how important a down payment can be in lowering your monthly payment. Or in deciding just how little you can put down and still afford the payment.

How to lower your monthly payment Finally, a mortgage calculator can help you know where your sweet spot of affordability is. If the estimated payment is too high, you can consider these strategies to lower it: Buy less house . It sounds simple, but it may not be easy to adjust your expectations at first. Start looking at smaller homes or longer commutes. You may find the perfect — and more affordable — house. Make a larger down payment. (You'll also avoid paying PMI.) Qualify for a lower interest rate. Extend the loan term. Learn more: How a 40-year mortgage works Mortgage calculator FAQs What mortgage can I afford with a $70,000 salary? A $70,000 salary could help you comfortably afford a home of roughly $210,000. However, the exact number will depend on your mortgage rate, down payment amount, and whether you have other monthly debt payments. How much income do you need for a $400,000 mortgage? You would need roughly a $100,000 salary (probably a little more) to afford monthly payments on a $400,000 mortgage. This means a gross monthly income of at least $8,334. How much income do you need for a $500,000 mortgage? The recommended income for a $500,000 mortgage is at least $125,000, or $10,417 per month before taxes.

Read our full review of Capital One What is a high-yield savings account? A high-yield savings account (HYSA) is a type of deposit account offered by brick-and-mortar banks, online banks, neobanks, and credit unions. As with traditional savings accounts, high-yield savings accounts typically don’t offer debit cards or check-writing privileges; you may be able to transfer money between your HYSA and other accounts via online transfers. An HYSA functions similarly to a traditional savings account, except you can earn much more interest. In some cases, you can get an annual percentage yield (APY) that is 10 times higher than the national average savings account rate. In fact, HYSAs currently offer some of the highest rates available on deposit products, with some financial institutions advertising APYs over 4%. High-yield savings accounts typically have no minimum opening balance requirements or monthly fees, though some banks may require you to maintain a minimum balance to earn interest or avoid a monthly service charge. Depending on the financial institution, you may earn the same rate regardless of your balance, or your APY may be tiered based on your balance. High-yield savings accounts vs. traditional savings accounts High-yield savings accounts work the same way traditional savings accounts do; the main difference is the interest rate. Savings account interest rates are typically less than 1%, while high-yield savings accounts offer rates as high as 4% or more. Fees, restrictions, and minimum deposit requirements depend on the financial institution for both account types, and both types of accounts are FDIC-insured. Read more: High-yield savings account vs. traditional savings account: Which one is better? Why open a savings account? What is APY? A high-yield savings account’s interest rate represents how much you’ll earn in simple interest (interest earned on the principal balance). The annual percentage yield (APY) is the rate of return, including compound interest, which is the interest you earn on the principal balance and accrued interest. Most savings accounts compound interest daily or monthly. The more often interest compounds, the faster your money will grow. HYSAs come with variable interest rates. That means your bank or credit union can change your APY at any time. Generally, APYs increase when the economy is doing well, and the Federal Reserve raises its benchmark rate. Conversely, rates can drop when the economy weakens, and the Fed lowers rates. Read more: What is annual percentage yield (APY)? What is a good savings account interest rate? What is compound interest, and how is it calculated? Savings interest rates today Pros and cons of high-yield savings accounts There are many benefits of opening a high-yield savings account, particularly the opportunity to earn a competitive rate on your balance. However, there are some drawbacks to consider as well. Let’s take a closer look at the pros and cons of high-yield savings accounts: Pros: Higher interest rates: You’ll generally earn more interest than you would with a traditional savings account. Compound interest: Compounding interest helps your balance grow more quickly. Interest in an HYSA may compound daily or monthly. Accessibility: These accounts are a great place to stash money you may need to access quickly, such as your emergency fund. Other types of accounts, such as certificates of deposit (CDs), offer high rates but impose penalties if you withdraw money prior to the maturity date. Minimal or no fees: Fees with high-yield savings accounts are rare, so you won’t need to worry about these costs eating into your balance. Low-risk: High-yield savings accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). Plus, unlike investments, account performance isn’t tied to the stock market and you can’t lose money, making HYSAs a low-risk option for your money. Cons: Variable rates: Your savings account’s APY can increase or decrease over time. While individual banks set rates at their discretion, these rates are loosely tied to the federal funds rate. Banks may choose to increase or decrease savings rates when the Fed adjusts its target rate. Minimum balance requirement: Some accounts may have a high minimum opening deposit. Tiered APYs: Some banks may have tiered APYs depending on the deposit amount. For instance, you may earn a higher rate if you deposit $5,000 vs. $100. So, while a $5,000 deposit isn’t necessarily required, it could result in a better APY. Better for short-term savings: High-yield savings accounts aren’t the best choice for long-term savings goals, like retirement. Investment accounts tend to offer higher long-term returns. Withdrawal limits may apply: Depending on your bank, you may have a limit on monthly withdrawals. Read more: Understanding the pros and cons of high-yield savings accounts Alternatives to high-yield savings accounts An HYSA can be a smart place to store your savings, but it's not your only option. Here's a look at some of the alternatives you may want to consider. Money market accounts Money market accounts and high-yield savings accounts both offer higher interest rates compared to traditional savings accounts. However, these accounts come with different features. For instance, MMAs typically offer check-writing abilities and debit cards, though they might require higher minimum balances to earn the top interest rates. High-yield savings accounts, on the other hand, are designed to store your savings longer-term with fewer withdrawal options. Learn more about money market accounts vs. high-yield savings accounts. Read more: Money market account vs. high-yield savings account: Which is right for you? CDs Like high-yield savings accounts, CDs can provide a safe place to store your savings while earning a competitive return. The big difference is that CDs require you to lock in your money for a set period, known as the term, which can range from a few months to several years. For this reason, CDs are a better option for people who don't need immediate access to their funds. Learn more about high-yield savings accounts vs. CDs. Read more: High-yield savings account vs. CD: Which is right for you? Investing High-yield savings accounts and investing serve vastly different financial goals and risk profiles. HYSAs provide stable, low-risk returns with interest rates higher than traditional savings accounts. They're best for short-term financial goals or emergency funds due to their liquidity and FDIC insurance. Investing in bonds, stocks, mutual funds, and other securities typically involves higher risk — but also the potential for higher returns over the long run. Investing your money makes more sense for long-term financial goals like retirement since the returns generally outpace inflation and help grow wealth over time.

Historical savings rates Today's savings account rates are the highest they've been in more than a decade, making it a great time to put your money in one. Here's a look at how historical savings rates have changed since 2014. Tips for finding the best high-yield savings account Competitive rates are great, but considering other factors besides APY can help you find an account that best meets your needs. New account offers Look at high-yield savings account offers for new depositors with high APYs, low to no account fees, and are free to open. High savings account rates will earn you more interest, but the financial institution offering those rates might not necessarily be the best option for your finances, so do your research before opening an account. Required deposits Research applicable deposit requirements. Is there a minimum initial deposit requirement? Do any other deposit requirements apply? Are there tiered APYs depending on your deposit amount? Fees Some accounts may have monthly maintenance fees or other fees. Look into which fees may apply before opening a new account. Accessibility Understand how you can access your money before opening a new account. For example, can you log into an online dashboard? Does your bank have a mobile app? Is it connected to an ATM network? Deposit options Review available deposit options. Are mobile check deposits via a mobile banking app an option? Can you make direct deposits via an ATM? Account linking Look into whether you can link your new account to an existing checking account at another bank. Make sure there are no restrictions or waiting periods when it comes to accessing your money. Read more: How to choose the right high-yield savings account for you How to open a high-yield savings account Once you’ve determined the best high-yield savings account for you, opening one is simple and can be done in person or online. You’ll generally need to provide your personal information, proof of identity, and address to open a new account. Make sure you have your driver’s license, Social Security number, and copies of a recent mortgage statement or utility bill. Depending on the account, a minimum deposit amount could apply when you open your HYSA account. If that’s the case, you’ll also need to be ready to transfer money from an existing account to meet the deposit requirement. Learn more about opening a high-yield savings account . HYSA frequently asked questions (FAQs) Is your money safe in a HYSA? As long as your account is held by an FDIC- or NCUA-insured institution, your money is federally insured up to the $250,000 limit. How often do HYSA rates change? Savings account rates are subject to change at your bank’s discretion. To get the most recent rate information for the accounts you’re considering, you’ll need to visit those institutions’ websites or call them directly to learn more. Can you withdraw money from a HYSA? Yes, you can withdraw money from a high-yield savings account. However, these accounts may have rules in place regarding the maximum number of withdrawals you can make within a given month or statement period without incurring a fee. What is the highest paying high-yield savings account? Among our list of the 10 best high-yield savings accounts, the highest rate available is 5.05% APY, offered by EverBank. Do you pay taxes on high-yield savings accounts? Yes, the interest earnings from high-yield savings accounts are considered taxable income. You should receive a Form 1099-INT from your bank if you earn more than $10 in interest during the year, which you need to report on your tax return. Are high-yield savings accounts still worth it? High-yield savings accounts are one of the best places to keep extra cash, whether for your emergency fund or short-term savings. The best rates currently hover between 4% and 5% APY. Can savings account interest rates change? Interest rates on savings accounts can change at any time. They're influenced by several factors, including the federal funds rate, general economic conditions, and individual bank policies. What type of bank account gives the most interest? Typically, high-yield savings accounts, CDs, and money market accounts offer higher interest rates compared to standard checking or savings accounts. Can you lose money in a high-yield savings account? In most cases, you won't lose money in a high-yield savings account as long as the financial institution is insured by the FDIC or NCUA, which cover up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution, per ownership category. However, there are certain instances when your HYSA could lose money. Best high-yield savings account methodology Our grading system, collected and carefully reviewed by our personal finance experts, comprised nearly 300 data points for approximately 30 federally insured savings accounts to develop our list of the top 10 high-yield savings accounts. We considered accounts with yields higher than the national average for traditional savings accounts. We evaluated these accounts according to several key metrics, including annual percentage yield, minimum opening deposit, minimum balance requirement, monthly fees, compounding frequency, and more. The accounts on our list could earn a maximum of 45 points across all metrics. Here’s a closer look at the categories we considered: Annual percentage yield (APY): Accounts with higher APYs were rewarded with more points than those with lower APYs. Note that rates on our list are current at the time of publishing but are subject to change at any time. Minimum balance to earn interest: Some banks and credit unions require a minimum balance to earn the advertised rate. We favored accounts that had no or low minimum balance requirements. Minimum opening deposit: Many high-yield savings accounts require a minimum deposit to open an account. High-yield savings accounts with no or low minimum deposit requirements were given preference in our rankings. Monthly fees: It’s not uncommon for high-yield accounts to charge a monthly maintenance or service fee. We rewarded accounts with no monthly fees. Compounding frequency: Compounding can happen daily, monthly, or even annually. We awarded more points to accounts that compound interest frequently. Account bonus: Accounts with a current bonus promotion earned extra points. Maximum bonus amount: We awarded more points to the accounts with higher welcome bonuses. Customer service contact methods: Our team awarded one point for every contact method available to customers (phone, email, chat). Mobile app rating: High-yield savings accounts at banks with a higher average mobile app rating on the Apple and Google storefronts scored more points than those with lower user ratings.

In the wake of the recent elections in Germany, European markets are reflecting uncertainty as investors weigh potential impacts. While the euro (EURUSD=X) briefly surged due to conservative victories, market reactions have been mixed as traders continue to eye global opportunities. In the US there is a wait-and-see approach regarding tariffs, with expectations that the situation will ultimately be resolved, similar to President Trump's negotiation style. FedWatch Advisors founder and CIO Ben Emons joins Market Domination Overtime hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to share his insights on the market environment (^GSPC,&nbsp;^IXIC,&nbsp;^DJI), stating that markets are still \"banking\" on Trump's tariffs to go into effect early March. \"It will ultimately all come together because this is the way President Trump sort of manages this process, right? A lot of threats,\" Emons says. \"But then it gets the parties at the table and there's a conclusion\" Regarding the German elections, Emons highlights the significant shift that could come by saying \"it's a big swing to the right again in Germany, which is happening across the Eurozone over the last several years.\" \"I think it's really a reflection of voters just being really uneasy with everything that was done during the pandemic, in the aftermath,\" he adds.

The vote was a test of investor views about the value of DEI programs, which many companies added or beefed up starting in 2020 amid the Black Lives Matter movement. Growing conservative pushback has led several large U.S. companies, including Meta, Alphabet and Amazon.com, to drop their DEI goals before and after Donald Trump's return to the U.S. presidency.

General Principles Reuters is committed to unbiased, independent journalism. Accepting funds for advertising or sponsored content allows Reuters to expand our coverage of global news and events consistent with the Trust Principles. The following guidelines apply to all advertising and explain how Reuters protects our journalistic integrity and the trust of our readers and customers while working with advertisers and sponsors. No relationship with an Advertiser or advertising deal may compromise Reuters’ strict compliance with the Trust Principles, which require independence, integrity and freedom from bias. Reuters editorial staff should not create, edit, influence or otherwise contribute to the production of advertising for a client, nor should a Reuters journalist appear in any client advertising. Advertisements should be clearly distinguishable from content created by Reuters’ editorial staff. If necessary to make the distinction, an advertisement should be prominently marked “Advertisement” (or its equivalent). Advertisers are responsible for the content of their advertisements. They are responsible for ensuring that their advertising complies with all applicable laws, regulations and guidelines and is not false or misleading. Advertisements should not reflect the views of Reuters or its editorial staff. Even so, Reuters reserves the right to reject or remove any advertisement if in Reuters opinion the advertisement is inaccurate or misleading, or could harm Reuters reputation. 2. Display Advertising Guidelines The Advertiser must agree to Reuters advertising terms and conditions. Advertisers must confirm in writing they have the right to use any third party’s intellectual property, e.g., trademarks, copyright, graphics, music, etc., and that they have obtained all necessary clearances, including the right to use a person’s name, image or likeness. Reuters trademarks may not be used in any third-party advertising without Reuters prior written consent. Advertising must match all Reuters technical and creative specifications. Reuters does not accept advertising that contains pictures or text advocating prejudice or discrimination based on race, national origin, religion, disability or handicap, gender, age, or sexual orientation. 3. Sponsored Advertising Guidelines Sponsorship means a third-party finances in whole or in part Reuters editorial or Reuters Plus content, like an event or content on Reuters.com, with a view to promoting the sponsor. The following guidelines apply to content independently created by Reuters news department, but funded in whole or in part by a paying sponsor: Sponsorship of editorial content and events should be approved by the Editor-in-Chief or their designee who will determine whether sponsorship is permissible based on the guidelines below. Accepting funding from sponsors to create editorially independent content may allow Reuters to enrich our news file, expand our offerings for readers and customers, or explore previously examined news subjects in a new way or with a more in-depth analysis. Reuters may accept funding from paying sponsors if we would produce the content even without the funding because it is newsworthy. Reuters may agree to accept funding for content if the editorial leadership of Reuters News, including the Editor-in-Chief, agrees that the sponsorship deal is consistent with Reuters editorial standards and the Trust Principles. Sponsored content should be editorially independent content that is just as valuable, unbiased and reliable as all other Reuters news content. This means: At the beginning of a sponsorship deal, Reuters and the sponsor may agree on broad subject areas for coverage. The sponsor may suggest more specific topics for Reuters to cover, but Reuters is not obligated to accept the sponsor’s ideas and should do so only if, in Reuters editorial discretion, the topics are newsworthy and of legitimate interest to our readers. Reuters journalists, or journalists acting at the direction of Reuters editorial staff, should collect facts and information, and produce and edit the content without input or influence by the sponsor, to the same standards that apply to other Reuters news content. Reuters should not show copy to sponsors prior to publication. The following guidelines apply to content created by Reuters Plus under the direction of a sponsor: Content created by Reuters Plus should be attributed to Reuters Plus, which should be described as the content marketing unit of Reuters. There should be no implication that the content is associated with, or created by, the Reuters newsroom. 4. Privacy: Cookies and Interest-based Advertising 4.1 Collection & Sharing of data Collection of personal information and use of cookies and tracking technologies must comply with the Thomson Reuters Privacy Statement , opens new tab and the Thomson Reuters Cookie & IBA Policy , opens new tab . Among the key rules in those policies: Reuters and our Advertisers should have a lawful basis for collecting personal information and should collect only the minimum amount of data needed. In this context, cookie IDs, IP addresses, and other identifiers should be considered personal information. Collection or use of special categories of data (such as, for example, age, location, race, and political beliefs) should be approved in advance by the Thomson Reuters Privacy Office. Reuters and our Advertisers should have a process in place to promptly respond to requests by data subjects to access or delete their data, or opt out of the use or sale of their data. 4.2 Cookies and other data collection technology Advertisers must have Reuters prior written consent to install cookies on users’ computers or use pixels, web beacons, or any other data-collecting technology, and those third-party mechanisms must be added to the Reuters consent management tool. Where local laws and regulations require individual user consent, such consent should be obtained in advance. Neither Reuters nor our Advertisers may use any tools to bypass user controls or the requirement of prior explicit consent. Cookies and other data collection technology, and any data collected therefrom, may be used by Advertisers only in connection with advertising. Any deviation from this principle with any Advertiser must be reflected in a written agreement with the Advertiser that has been approved, in advance, by the Thomson Reuters Privacy Office. 4.3 Contextual Targeting Advertisements may be sold against keywords to appear in specific content on the Reuters site, but Advertisers may not purposefully advertise specifically alongside stories about themselves. 4.4 Interest-Based Advertising (IBA) Interest-based advertising, also referred to as “targeted advertising,” “personalized advertising,” and “behavioral advertising,” generally means personalized and/or targeted advertising is served based on the browsing history of the user, user profiles, and other information collected about them by Reuters or our Advertisers and their partners. Advertisers must ensure that Interest-based advertising complies with Thomson Reuters policies (including the procedures outlined in the Thomson Reuters Privacy Statement , opens new tab and Cookie & IBA Policy , opens new tab ), as well as industry best practices. 5. Labeling Guidelines The following guidelines set forth labeling language that should be used to identify different types of Advertising on Reuters properties: Display Advertising Advertising should be clearly distinguishable from editorial and transparent to the user. Advertisements should not have the same look and feel as a Reuters news story, to avoid confusion on the part of the customer. Native advertisements should be marked “ADVERTISEMENT” (or its equivalent) at the top of the advertisement. If necessary to distinguish them from editorial content, add a border or the advertiser’s logo. Reuters may require a disclaimer to distinguish the advertisement from editorial content. Sponsored Editorially Independent Content: Content: “Sponsors are not involved in the creation of this or any other Reuters news content.” Event: “This event was sponsored/sponsored in part by [Brand X]. It was independently produced by Reuters editorial staff.” Promotion/use on Reuters social media: “Sponsored by” Reuters Plus Created Content for the Sponsor: On Reuters website: No reference to Reuters other than Reuters Plus. Display sponsoring brand logo. Use the following labeling: “This [article/content] was produced for Brand [X] by Reuters Plus, the content marketing unit of Reuters.” Reuters Plus social media promotion of custom/brand content produced by Reuters Plus: “Produced by Reuters Plus for [Brand name]” Reuters Plus social media promotion of custom/brand content produced by Reuters Plus: “Produced by Reuters Plus for [Brand name]” On brand site or platform: Must have a reference to Reuters Plus and add “This content was produced for [Brand name] by Reuters Plus, the content marketing unit of Reuters.” Branded event: “Produced for Brand [X] by Reuters Plus, the content marketing unit of Reuters.” Reuters Plus social media promotion/use of custom/brand event: “Produced by Reuters Plus for [brand name].” 6. Restrictions on Content/Advertising It is the responsibility of the advertiser to ensure that advertising complies with all applicable laws, regulations, guidelines and industry standards and that is not false or misleading. Reuters may accept the following categories of advertising under certain circumstances: POLITICAL Reuters accepts public policy, government and government agency advertising as well as advocacy ads, political party or candidate advertising. Advocacy, political party and candidate advertising cannot contain false or misleading information and should not create the impression that Reuters is biased in favor of one candidate or policy over another. They must be clearly labeled as detailed above in the Labeling Guidelines. All advocacy, political party and candidate advertising should be vetted by the Ethics and Standards Editor and the Head of Reuters Professional. In the case of political advertising, whether for a candidate for office or for advocacy of a policy, all advertisements should also carry the name of the organization paying for the advertisement, such as “Paid for by [Organization name]”. GAMBLING Reuters accepts advertising for betting, lotteries or gambling where it is legal. It is the advertiser’s responsibility to ensure that all advertisements are in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and guidelines. ALCOHOL Reuters accepts alcoholic beverage advertising where it is legal. It is the advertiser’s responsibility to ensure that all advertisements are in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and guidelines. PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, DIET DRUGS, DIET REGIMENTS AND OTHER HEALTH PRODUCTS Reuters accepts advertising for prescription drugs, diet drugs, diet regimens and other health products. It is the advertiser’s responsibility to ensure their advertising to consumers is in compliance with applicable laws and rules, such as the FDA’s guidelines for Direct to Consumer (DTC) advertising in the U.S. Reuters may not accept the following categories of advertising: TOBACCO Reuters does not accept tobacco brand or tobacco product advertisements. FIREARMS AND OTHER WEAPONS Reuters does not accept firearm/weapons advertisements. RELIGIOUS Reuters does not accept advertisements from religious organizations. OBSCENE or PORNOGRAPHIC Reuters does not accept advertising that it deems to contain erotic, indecent or primarily sexual content or purpose. Reuters reserves the right to turn down any advertising at its discretion.

{"url": "https://www.reuters.com/graphics/DIVERSITY-REPORT/2024/xmpjbgdrapr/", "text": "World Business Legal Markets Breakingviews More Diversity and inclusion at Reuters in 2023 Foreword Diversity, equity, and inclusion are fundamental pillars of our journalistic mission. As we impartially and independently cover wars, financial upheaval and political unrest, the remarkable diversity of our sources and our journalists set Reuters apart. Diversity strengthens the fabric of our newsroom. It deepens the quality and depth of our reporting, enabling us to better serve our global audience. In particular this year, our coverage of the world’s conflicts and elections throughout the globe showcase our unique ability to combine local understanding with global insights. The dedication and resilience of our reporters on the ground exemplify the values we hold dear at Reuters. In our Annual Diversity Report for 2023, we document the progress made in fostering a more inclusive newsroom, while acknowledging the challenges that lie ahead. Last year, we made progress in diversifying our leadership, with a notable increase in the proportion of senior leaders from racially or ethnically diverse backgrounds. We continue to make progress in increasing the number of women in leadership, with a three-percentage point increase to 39% from 36%. However, there is still much work to be done, particularly in addressing barriers to progression and promoting equity at all levels of our newsroom. As Reuters delivers all the news that matters in an increasingly complex, polarized world, our newsroom, too, must reflect the audiences we serve. Our commitment to this goal remains unwavering. Alessandra Galloni Editor-in-Chief, Reuters You can read last year’s report here . A reminder of our goals In 2022, we set new goals for 2023-2025 aimed specifically at enhancing the diversity of our editorial leadership. We committed to: Increasing the overall ethnic and racial diversity within senior leadership levels by 20% or more by the end of 2025 Doubling the number of Black leaders by the end of 2025 Ensuring that 45% or more of senior leadership positions are held by women by the end of 2025 Raising the proportion of roles, including promotions, filled by internal talent to 65% by the end of 2025, to foster growth and development within our newsroom Over the past 12 months, we have increased the number of Black leaders within our newsroom by 13% and improved the representation of racially and ethnically diverse senior leaders by 11%. The proportion of roles filled by internal talent, including promotions, has increased by 3 percentage points, bringing it to 54% from 51%. Although we still have work to do, we are heading in the right direction. Our data Getting better data Diversity data is provided by employees voluntarily. In 2020 we launched the Count Me In campaign, an ongoing effort to encourage staff to supply their diversity details. The data provided has continued to increase. By Dec 2023 around 68% of newsroom staff had volunteered their race or ethnicity details, up 21 percentage points since Dec 2020; 47% had volunteered their sexual orientation, an increase of around 32 percentage points since Dec 2020. Here is the availability of data for the Reuters newsroom: Survey Gender Gender identity Sexual orientation Race or ethnicity Disability Dec. 2020 99.90% 15.60% 15.30% 47.20% 1.70% Dec. 2021 99.70% 28.30% 28.10% 59.60% 6.80% Dec. 2022 99.50% 39.00% 39.60% 63.30% 13.90% Dec. 2023 99.70% 46.20% 47.20% 68.10% 23.40% Notes about our data The charts are based on our data on Dec 31, 2023. The data is aggregated to conceal private individual information. For Reuters commercial employees, the definition of senior leadership is director level and above, as across Thomson Reuters. For the newsroom, we have expanded the definition of senior leadership to include all managers in the three layers below the Editor-In-Chief. Some employees currently have the option of selecting a “not specified” category. We believe some employees have actively selected that category because other categories do not cover their ethnicity. We are treating this data separately from an absence of data. Terms such as “Asian” and “Black” are expressed differently in different countries; we have aggregated them where appropriate. In some categories, we capture only a small number of all employees. In part, that is because only a small number of employees have the option of providing their data. Collecting certain types of data in some countries is not permitted for privacy reasons. Other countries level criminal sanctions for the information we are asking staff to provide, particularly around race, sexual orientation, and gender identity, and so we have chosen not to ask our people to do so.

REUTERS/Sofiia Gatilova Learning and development are vital to an equitable workplace. Upskilling not only strengthens our newsroom but also keeps us at the forefront of an ever-changing industry. In 2023, our Editorial Learning team provided a range of initiatives designed to help our journalists excel in their roles. Varied Training Opportunities We offered training sessions from small, focused workshops to webinars covering topics including journalistic ethics, source building, beat reporting, company news, and pitching. We revitalized our bootcamp for new hires with five days of interactive sessions with senior editors, covering topics including cybersecurity, mental health, and building a successful career at Reuters. Our Newsroom Leadership Seminar(s) helped managers hone skills in managing a global, diverse newsroom, fostering strong teams, and maintaining personal well-being.

REUTERS/Angela Ponce Introducing Focused Learning Weeks In March we launched our Editorial Learning Weeks, encouraging reporters and editors to take time to focus on their professional development. More than 2,200 journalists participated in 40 live virtual events, from effective writing for Reuters to fact-checking, source building in challenging environments, crafting compelling headlines and generative AI in journalism. We enriched our e-learning options for self-paced learning and transformed the Reuters News Academy into a comprehensive hub of learning materials and instructive videos. Future Plans In 2024, we have built out extensive AI training, from basic familiarization to advanced tool integration, and enhanced our management training. We have expanded opportunities for cross-team projects and secondments, and made roles more flexible where possible, enabling career advancement while accommodating individual circumstances. Building An AI-Infused Newsroom A surfer dives off his board at sunset in Encinitas, California, U.S., August 28, 2023. REUTERS/Mike Blake Generative AI is a transformative opportunity for Reuters. Our approach is deeply rooted in our Trust Principles . Jane Barrett, Reuters newly appointed Head of AI Strategy, shares insights on our approach. Generative AI and Reuters Commitment to Excellence The introduction of generative AI is a pivotal moment for Reuters, providing a unique chance to leverage innovative tech in journalism. Central to this transformation are Reuters Trust Principles , which have consistently guided our work since 1941. These principles emphasize the importance of expanding and adapting our news services while ensuring their reliability and impartiality. We are deeply committed to AI innovation, but not at the expense of accuracy or fairness. Our AI teams are diligently optimizing prompts, refining models, and integrating AI into our systems to enhance the speed and efficiency of our reporting, but the final review of all content remains the responsibility of our seasoned editors to maintain the highest journalistic standards. Maintaining Integrity and Combating Bias Maintaining the integrity of our reporting is a priority. When biases are identified in models, our Trust Principles dictate immediate collaboration between data scientists and engineers to address and mitigate them. Empowering Diversity and Innovation A rewarding aspect of our AI journey is witnessing diverse participation, with employees from various backgrounds and levels engaging in AI training, prompting workshops, and tool evaluations. This inclusive environment allows all team members to create personalized solutions for tasks that may be time-consuming, eliminating technological barriers and encouraging innovation. Advancing Meaningful Journalism Reuters is dedicated to creating an AI-empowered newsroom that enables our journalists to concentrate on meaningful, original reporting. While AI can assist with research and rote tasks, the essence of journalism—capturing a moment in a photograph, offering expert insight, or building trust with sources—remains a human endeavor, and one on which our 173-year legacy will continue to be built. Building Inclusive Journalism: Reuters Commitment to Race and Justice Reporting By Kat Stafford, Race and Justice Editor, Reuters Migrants, mostly from Venezuela, walk on top of railroad cars as they get ready to continue their journey to the U.S. border in the site known as El Basurero, a stretch of land next to a trash dump and the railroad, in Huehuetoca, State of Mexico, Mexico, April 26, 2023. REUTERS/Gustavo Graf In September 2023, Reuters made a significant stride towards more inclusive and representative news coverage by establishing its inaugural Global Race and Justice team. This team, comprising a U.S.-based correspondent, a Europe-based correspondent, and a data journalist, focuses on producing stories through the lens of race and justice. They have already delivered impactful work, including stories on the crucial role of Black voters in the upcoming U.S. presidential election, prison overcrowding ahead of the Paris Summer Olympics, and an exclusive interview with Wales’ then First Minister Vaughn Gething. I am immensely proud of their achievements and excited about what lies ahead. In my role as Race and Justice Editor, I help lead our collective efforts to tell stories from a wider range of perspectives. In my first few months, I prioritized listening to colleagues worldwide, crafting a blueprint for newsroom engagement. This aims to ensure our journalists not only seek diverse perspectives but also provide context and nuance in their reporting. We have integrated source diversity, or equitable sourcing into our annual newsroom goals and started tracking relevant stories, helping to ensure that we include voices from women, people of color, and other marginalized groups. Early successes include coverage of efforts to dismantle diversity, equity, and inclusion, Tesla’s race bias lawsuits, global reparations for transatlantic slavery, indigenous rights in Australia, and efforts to engage voters of color in the U.S. election. However, much work remains. Building trust with communities of color and other underserved groups is a long-term commitment. The past four years, marked by global inequities amid COVID-19 and worldwide racial justice protests, have highlighted the need to integrate race coverage into every beat. From corporate boardrooms to housing, financial markets, health, AI, politics, and migration, race and gender intersect all coverage areas globally. As demographics diversify, newsrooms must reflect and include marginalized perspectives. Our goal is to continue producing robust coverage that exposes structural racism, inequities, and gender bias. I look forward to another year of transformative reporting. Enhancing Visual Storytelling: Progress and Highlights from Our Pictures Team By Rickey Rogers, Global Editor, Reuters Pictures In our 2020 Diversity Report , I outlined our strategy to address the gender disparity within our photography team. By tracking the number of monthly assignments allocated to women photographers, we have been able to drive meaningful change behind and in front of the camera. Our success has only been possible through a shift in mindset among hiring managers, and a cultural change within the team. Diversity of age, race, gender, and cultural background are essential for bringing varied perspectives and delivering more inclusive journalism. I would like to highlight the commendable efforts of the team leaders, particularly those in Asia and Latin America. We are proud to feature some of the work from our new photojournalists who have recently joined our global pictures team. Building a Talent Pipeline in Latin America By Claudia Daut, Latam Editor, Reuters Pictures Union members participate in a march during May Day celebrations, in Buenos Aires, Argentina May 1, 2023. REUTERS/Mariana Nedelcu When I first started exploring how we should approach increasing gender diversity on my team data was my guide. In 2018, just 14% of the photographers I assigned in Latin America were women. It was evident that a lot of work was needed. Initially, my focus was on recruiting seasoned photographers. But turning to social media proved to be a game-changer, allowing me to discover emerging, lesser-known photographers eager to show their work and talent. I joined women photographers' cooperatives across Latin America and followed platforms advocating for female photographers, I conducted personal conversations with promising photographers to encourage their involvement in assignments or story pitches as trial opportunities. The work produced by these photographers has been inspiring and uplifting. As our mentorship and inclusion efforts gained traction, an increasing number of women photographers approached me directly, helping to build trust. By the end of 2023, women made up 36% of my team, marking a 22-percentage point increase from our starting point. This is progress, but there is a lot more work to do to enhance gender diversity and continue to champion diverse voices in our storytelling. Being Intentionally Inclusive By Masood Ahmad, Asia Editor, Reuters Pictures Gender diversity has historically been a challenge in Asia. However, I am proud of the progress our team has made in this area. The proportion of photo contributions by women in my team has increased from 4% in 2018 to 36% by the end of 2023.

A diverse team is crucial to authentically reflecting the world we cover. A critical aspect of our journey in Asia has involved confronting outdated industry perspectives that still question women's suitability for photojournalism. Our aim is to attain equal representation in terms of gender, while ensuring equity in compensation, opportunities, and career growth. The collective commitment of our newsroom towards this goal is truly inspiring. By maintaining our focus on diversity and inclusion, we aspire to build a team that not only excels in photojournalism, but also accurately represents the diverse world we capture through our lens. Paving Diverse Paths: Nurturing Tomorrow’s Reporters Journalism thrives on diverse voices and perspectives. Here, we highlight two impactful Reuters programs: the partnership with the Overseas Press Club Foundation and the Thomson Reuters Neurodiversity Internship Program. Locals are evacuated on an excavator from a flooded area in the aftermath of Storm Daniel in Larissa, Greece, September 10, 2023. REUTERS/Elias Marcou Overseas Press Club Foundation Reuters has a longstanding partnership with the New York based Overseas Press Club (OPC) Foundation, which aims to support the next generation of international correspondents. Every year, the Foundation awards fellowships and scholarships to 18 university students. The organization, which is affiliated with the Overseas Press Club of America, works with media partners including Reuters to arrange work experience for the award winners by placing them in internships around the world and supporting their independent reporting projects. The winners “share a desire to go to the far corners of the globe to practice truthful, ethical journalism and to produce deep and insightful stories for their audiences,” according to the OPC Foundation’s website ( https://www.overseaspressclubfoundation.org/ ). Reuters Global Managing Editor for Business News Tiffany Wu and Global News Desk Editor Ed Tobin sit on the board of the OPC Foundation and are among the panel of judges who select the award winners. They also choose up to four of the awardees to become Reuters summer interns every year, consulting with bureau chiefs and specialist editors to match the students’ skills and interests with our global newsroom needs. This has been a great talent pipeline for Reuters. Many of our interns have gone on to pursue distinguished careers as foreign correspondents and bureau chiefs. Among them is Caroline Stauffer, our Canada bureau chief, who first joined Reuters as an OPC intern in Mexico in 2010. I am incredibly grateful to the Overseas Press Club for providing a path into Reuters. With most journalism internships based in the United States, I would have found it hard to secure one coming out of a degree program in international affairs on the heels of the great recession. The OPC provided me with a scholarship to work with the Reuters Mexico City bureau for a summer -- my dream placement. It also offered training and introduced me to other journalists in New York City before I left. I was finally able to visualize a career path in business journalism in Latin America. In Mexico, I worked with reporters on economic stories and wrote about everything from butterfly migration to abortion rights in Mexico. I learned how to cover markets and Latin American currencies, giving me a good base for all the roles I have had at the company since. I moved on to Peru covering mining and the country’s colorful politics before taking my first foray into agriculture reporting in Brazil. I travelled far and wide, broke news on a far-reaching corruption scandal and camped out on an indigenous reservation to report on illegal farming on the edge of the Amazon. I recall being asked to help select the interns that year, as a former Reuters intern myself. After four years in Brazil, I started my first job as a manager a week after the Rio Olympics as the South Latin America Bureau Chief based in Buenos Aires. I learned about bond markets, the Argentine Pope and the country’s obsession with beef. Before the role of Canada Bureau Chief, I served as the Chicago Bureau Chief, where I oversaw agriculture coverage across the Americas for six years. During that time, I navigated the US-China trade war, the pandemic, and wild swings in commodity markets. I continue to approach my work with a global perspective, and I closely follow the fine journalism produced by Reuters and other OPC partners all over the world. Building Careers for Neurodiverse Talent at Reuters By Hezron Selvi, Asia Speed Editor/Deputy Global Speed Editor Hindu devotees worship the Sun god amidst foam covering the polluted Yamuna river during the Hindu religious festival of Chhath Puja in New Delhi, India, November 20, 2023. REUTERS/Anushree Fadnavis Caregivers for individuals with autism often grapple with a pressing question: What will happen to their loved ones in the future as adults? As someone who has raised a person on the autism spectrum, this concern is close to my heart. While India, like many other countries, has developed strong educational systems for individuals with additional support needs, there is a significant gap in integrating them into the workforce and society as adults, leaving many confined to their homes. In 2018, I proposed to HR in India and our global centers in the Philippines and Poland a plan to create lasting job opportunities for individuals on the autism spectrum. HR was supportive, but we encountered issues, particularly the intense sensory environment of newsrooms. This challenge stalled our progress until mid-2019. COVID-19, despite its challenges, prompted the transition to online and hybrid work models that better accommodate sensory needs. This allowed the launch of the Thomson Reuters Neurodiversity Internship Program. The program offers paid internships to 10 individuals on the autism spectrum in India, with each of our 20+ business functions committed to hosting at least one intern. Our first group started in December 2020. Its success meant we have now had over 60 interns in five years. We currently have 20 interns with seven in the Reuters Bangalore newsroom—five of whom are now full-time employees. Working with neurodiverse individuals has reshaped our understanding, improving our patience, communication, and time management skills. It has required effort and adaptation from everyone involved. I aspire for this initiative to grow exponentially, becoming a global standard for talent acquisition in our newsroom and evolving from a project into business as usual. “Initially, I was afraid of writing Stocks Buzz, but with practice and understanding the format for writing and meeting readers’ expectations, I was able to progress from an intern to an employee. I am still learning every day, but the experiences have given me confidence to compile and write Buzzes. My job at Reuters is invaluable because it has exposed me to professional communication and various aspects of the office environment.” Rajarshi Roy, Correspondent – Consumer & Retail Reporting Team, Bangalore Bureau “I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to work at Reuters and with the amazing people in my team. This being my first job in a multinational organization, I got to learn a lot about the job, different work cultures and the way news is generated and published. This learning will go a long way.” Pavithra S, News Associate – News Support Team, Bangalore Bureau Living and Reporting the Story - The Israel/Gaza Conflict Palestinian woman Inas Abu Maamar, 36, embraces the body of her 5-year-old niece Saly, who was killed in an Israeli strike, at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, October 17, 2023. REUTERS/Mohammed Salem Covering the Israel/Gaza conflict poses a unique challenge for our dedicated team of reporters on the ground. They are tasked with reporting accurately and impartially while navigating the immediate dangers and emotional strain of living amidst the very stories they bring to the world. Balancing objective reporting with the personal impacts of the conflict is a delicate act of courage and resilience. James Mackenzie, our Bureau Chief for Israel, and Palestinian Territories, reflects on the extraordinary demands faced by our experienced team. Covering this war has been incredibly challenging, even for a team with substantial experience in this region. Every conflict presents unique difficulties, and it's hard to draw direct comparisons between situations like those in Russia, Ukraine, Iraq, or Afghanistan, and this one. A particular challenge of covering this war lies in the close-knit nature of our team. Within the same bureau, we have people who have directly suffered the impacts of war and must report on it professionally as Reuters journalists. Our colleagues in Gaza have lost relatives and homes, and in Israel, one of our team members attended three funerals in one day following the October 7 attack. This isn't to equate their experiences, but to highlight how intimately connected they are to this conflict and the immense pressure they face. Friends and family take cover as rocket sirens sound during the funeral of Sagiv Ben Zvi, 24, who was killed following the deadly infiltration by Hamas gunmen from the Gaza Strip as he attended the Nova festival in southern Israel, in Holon, Israel, October 26, 2023. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein Despite these challenges, our team has managed to balance the intense emotions people are experiencing with the professional focus needed to accurately report the events unfolding. I think the exceptional work done by our teams, recognized by awards for our video and photojournalism, is a testament not only to their professional expertise but also to the human qualities they bring to their work. For me, as a foreigner in the middle of all this, I am in awe of how they navigate their roles. Everyone involved has personal opinions and emotions about this war, which has stirred strong feelings globally, evident from American college campuses to European city protests. The psychological toll has been immense from the initial events of October 7 to the current developments in Gaza. Managing this strain is challenging both personally and as a team. However, our staff's attitude has been exemplary. We have a diverse team from Gaza, Israel, the West Bank, Israelis, Palestinians, Jews, Muslims, and Christians. While it has not always been smooth, the level of professionalism displayed by everyone as Reuters journalists is commendable and something our newsroom can rightfully be proud of. Prioritizing Mental Health: Reuters' Commitment to Supporting Our Journalists Acryclic on Canvas/Linda Pasquine, Gdansk Good mental health empowers our reporters to perform at their best. We are dedicated to improving access to resources that build resilience, creating a supportive work environment and to continuously seeking innovative ways to safeguard the mental well-being of our journalists. In 2023, we integrated a mental health and well-being component into our editorial risk assessments. This ensures that editors give priority to both mental and physical safety before assignments, making mental health a fundamental consideration and not an afterthought. We encourage our managers to debrief with reporters to mitigate the risk of psychological trauma and help create a self-care plan, especially after demanding assignments. In honor of World Mental Health Awareness Week, we organized various well-being activities, panel discussions, and events. These initiatives allowed our team to step back and focus on self-care and mental wellness. Highlights included: \"13 Things Mentally Strong People Don't Do\" - A conversation with author Amy Morin A 6-week course on \"Transforming Stress & Trauma-Affected Sleep\" Workshops on \"Setting Boundaries & Empowering Oneself as a Highly Sensitive Person\" Discussions on \"Supporting the Mental Well-being of Your Team\" \"Everything You Need to Know About the Perimenopause, Menopause & Mental Health (but were too afraid to ask)\" with author Kate Muir These activities complement the comprehensive range of mental health services we offer year-round, including: The CiC Trauma Program: Provides counseling for anyone dealing with stress or trauma, available to all staff, freelancers, and their families. Thomson Reuters Employee Assistance Program (EAP): Offers additional counseling services. The Peer Network: Established in 2015, comprising of over 70 journalists worldwide who volunteer to support colleagues needing someone to talk to. Regular Online Art Classes: Which serve as a creative outlet, and some of our journalists' artwork is showcased on our platforms. Reuters Mental Health & Resilience Resource: An online hub for all our mental health resources, expert guidance, and information. This provides journalists—employees, stringers, or freelancers—easy access to essential support to maintain mental health, build resilience, and seek help when needed. Reuters remains committed to enhancing mental health support for our editorial staff. Our ongoing aim is to ensure that every journalist, employee or freelancer, has the resources needed to maintain good mental health. Supporting Good Mental Health – The CiC-Reuters Partnership Harry Key, Head of Global Specialist Services, CiC Since 2006, CiC has partnered with Reuters to provide a Global Trauma Support program for all editorial staff, including freelancers and contractors, in various languages and locations. The program is designed for journalists exposed to stress and trauma, offering multi-lingual specialist referrals, face-to-face support, trauma sessions, and hostile environment training. Journalists face significant pressures, such as working in conflict zones, constant exposure to distressing content, mental health stigma, surveillance concerns, community hostility, and online harassment. The Peer Support Network at Reuters has grown to include over 70 peers across 26 countries, speaking 34 languages, providing confidential, empathetic spaces for colleagues to discuss work-related stress. Peer interactions are reported confidentially to CiC, allowing for comprehensive monitoring and anonymized feedback to Reuters, which helps address stressors while maintaining privacy. Reuters and CiC offer a confidential program focused on journalism-related trauma referrals, peer support, and proactive check-ins. Over the years, CiC's collaboration with Reuters leadership has strengthened, facilitating support beyond standard therapeutic referrals, and enhancing our industry-specific understanding. CiC's programs at Reuters are industry-leading, broadening the support scope to include all staff exposed to trauma, redefining traditional \"PTSD support for war correspondents.\" Senior leadership at Reuters plays a crucial role in promoting these programs, recognizing their importance for staff well-being and success. Through collaboration and innovative support strategies, CiC and Reuters have established a mental health-focused workplace culture that meets the editorial staff's needs and underscores the value of mental health support in the journalism industry. What’s next... We recognize that every action we take, no matter how small, contributes to building a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable newsroom. While we've made progress, we are committed to continuous improvement. Look out for: Enhanced AI training programs for our team. Expanded talent outreach initiatives to attract a more diverse group of individuals to our newsroom. Establishment of editorial leadership circles to support our newsroom managers. Increased opportunities for cross-team projects. Training for managers and editors in effectively supporting staff who are struggling with their mental health. Guidance on best practices for trauma reporting and handling graphic content. Launch of an editorial accelerator program aimed at supporting local mid-career talent. Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion is deeply rooted in our editorial mission: to deliver outstanding, unbiased, and trusted journalism on a global scale. We believe that a diverse and inclusive newsroom creates a more robust and insightful understanding of the world around us. By creating an environment where everyone feels valued and empowered, we can better serve our audience with diverse perspectives and high-quality reporting. We are confident that our continued efforts will enhance our newsroom and strengthen our ability to fulfil our mission.

REUTERS/Jason Cairnduff/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Summary Companies Musicians protest UK's AI copyright changes with silent album Proposed changes allow AI training on any lawfully accessed material Artists argue changes reverse copyright law principles LONDON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - More than 1,000 musicians, including Kate Bush and Cat Stevens, on Tuesday released a silent album to protest proposed changes to Britain's copyright laws, which could allow tech firms to train artificial intelligence models using their work. Creative industries globally are grappling with the legal and ethical implications of AI models that can produce their own output after being trained on popular works without necessarily paying the creators of the original content. Britain, which Prime Minister Keir Starmer wants to become an AI superpower , has proposed relaxing laws that currently give creators of literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works the right to control the ways their material may be used. The proposed changes would allow AI developers to train their models on any material to which they have lawful access, and would require creators to proactively opt out to stop their work being used. The changes have been heavily criticised by many artists, who say it would reverse the principle of copyright law, which grants exclusive control to creators for their work. \"In the music of the future, will our voices go unheard?,\" said Bush, whose 1985 hit \"Running Up That Hill\" enjoyed a resurgence in 2022 thanks to Netflix show \"Stranger Things\". The co-written album titled \"Is This What We Want?\" features recordings of empty studios and performance spaces to represent what organisers say is the potential impact on artists' livelihoods should the changes go ahead. The list of 12 tracks combined creates the sentence: \"The British government must not legalise music theft to benefit AI companies\". In a separate letter to The Times on Monday, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Elton John and Paul McCartney also warned about the proposals, saying that the current copyright system \"is one of the main reasons why rights holders work in Britain\". Bush, alongside 34 other artists including Dua Lipa, Ed Sheeran and Stephen Fry, signed the letter. A public consultation on the legal changes closes later on Tuesday. Responding to the album, a government spokesperson said the current copyright and AI regime was holding back the creative industries, media and AI sector from \"realising their full potential.\" \"We have engaged extensively with these sectors throughout and will continue to do so. No decisions have been taken,\" the spokesperson said, adding that the government's proposals will be set out in due course. Annie Lennox, Billy Ocean, Hans Zimmer, Tori Amos and The Clash are among the musicians urging the government to review its plans. \"The government's proposal would hand the life's work of the country's musicians to AI companies, for free, letting those companies exploit musicians’ work to outcompete them,\" said organiser Ed Newton-Rex, the founder of Fairly Trained, a non-profit that certifies generative AI companies for fairer training data practices. \"The UK can be leaders in AI without throwing our world-leading creative industries under the bus.\" ($1 = 0.7913 pounds) Sign up here.

Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Read more Summary Findings are latest evidence of ancient Martian ocean Such an ocean was potentially suitable for life to emerge WASHINGTON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Ground-penetrating radar data obtained by China's Zhurong rover has revealed buried beneath the Martian surface evidence of what look like sandy beaches from the shoreline of a large ocean that may have existed long ago on the northern plains of Mars . The findings are the latest evidence indicating the existence of this hypothesized ocean, called Deuteronilus, roughly 3.5 to 4 billion years ago, a time when Mars - now cold and desolate - possessed a thicker atmosphere and warmer climate. An ocean of liquid water on the Martian surface, according to scientists, potentially could have harbored living organisms, much like the primordial seas of early Earth. The rover, which operated from May 2021 to May 2022, journeyed about 1.2 miles (1.9 km) in an area that exhibits surface features suggestive of an ancient shoreline. Its ground-penetrating radar, which transmitted high-frequency radio waves into the ground that reflected off subsurface features, probed up to 80 meters (260 feet) beneath the surface. The radar images detected some 33-115 feet (10-35 meters) underground thick layers of material with properties similar to sand, all sloped in the same direction and at an angle similar to that of beaches on Earth just below the water where the sea meets the land. The researchers mapped these structures spanning three quarters of a mile (1.2 km) along the rover's path. \"The Martian surface has changed dramatically over 3.5 billion years, but by using ground-penetrating radar we found direct evidence of coastal deposits that weren't visible from the surface,\" said Guangzhou University planetary scientist Hai Liu, a member of the science team for China's Tianwen-1 mission that included the rover. On Earth, beach deposits of this size would have needed millions of years to form, the researchers said, suggesting that on Mars there was a large and long-lived body of water with wave action that distributed sediments carried into it by rivers flowing from nearby highlands. \"The beaches would have been formed by similar processes to those on Earth - waves and tides,\" said Liu, one of the leaders of the study published on Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , opens new tab . \"Such oceans would have profoundly influenced Mars' climate, shaped its landscape and created environments potentially suitable for life to emerge and thrive.\" \"Shorelines are great locations to look for evidence of past life,\" said planetary scientist and study co-author Michael Manga of the University of California, Berkeley. \"It's thought that the earliest life on Earth began at locations like this, near the interface of air and shallow water.\" The rover explored in the southern part of Utopia Planitia, a large plain in the Martian northern hemisphere. The researchers ruled out other possible explanations for the structures Zhurong detected. \"A primary part of this work was testing these other hypotheses. Wind-blown dunes were considered, but there were a few issues. First, dunes tend to come in groups, and these groups produce characteristic patterns not present in these deposits,\" Penn State geoscientist and study co-author Benjamin Cardenas said. \"We also considered ancient rivers, which exist in some nearby locations on Mars, but we rejected that hypothesis for similar reasons based on the patterns we saw in the deposits. And you don't typically get structures like this in lava flows, either. Beaches simply fit the observations the best,\" Cardenas said. Earth, Mars and the solar system's other planets formed roughly 4.5 billion years ago. That means Deuteronilus would have disappeared approximately a billion years into Martian history, when the planet's climate changed dramatically. Scientists said some of the water may have been lost to space while large amounts may remain trapped underground. A study , opens new tab published last year based on seismic data obtained by NASA's robotic InSight lander found that an immense reservoir of liquid water may reside deep under the Martian surface within fractured igneous rocks. For decades, scientists have used satellite images to trace Martian surface features resembling a shoreline. But any such evidence on the surface could have been erased or distorted by billions of years of wind erosion or other geological processes. That is not the case with the newly found structures, which were entombed over time under material deposited by dust storms, meteorite strikes or volcanism. \"These are beautifully preserved because they are still buried in the Martian subsurface,\" Cardenas said.

Models marched through a sprawling space that was outfitted with a dark green carpet and velvet curtains, parading lace-trimmed slip dresses, wool overcoats with rounded shoulders and double-breasted suits with lengthened lapels.

Kering is in the process of revamping Gucci, its biggest label, and earlier this month announced the abrupt departure of designer Sabato de Sarno after less than two years. De Sarno shifted Gucci's focus to more classic, minimalist designs, and emphasized a glossy red color in his collections. Speaking to journalists before the show, Gucci chief executive Stefano Cantino did not give precise timing for the upcoming change of creative director, and said executives were focused on \"working for the good of the brand.\" Previously one of the industry's biggest success stories, with fast growth between 2016 and 2020, the century-old label fell behind when shoppers' tastes shifted away from the baroque, gender-fluid designs by Alessandro Michele.

The Svalbard Global Seed Vault, set deep inside a mountain to withstand disasters from nuclear war to global warming , was launched in 2008 as a backup for the world's gene banks that store the genetic code for thousands of plant species. Protected by permafrost, the vault has received samples from across the world, and played a leading role between 2015 and 2019 in rebuilding seed collections damaged during the war in Syria. \"The seeds deposited this week represent not just biodiversity, but also the knowledge, culture and resilience of the communities that steward them,\" Executive Director Stefan Schmitz of the Crop Trust said in a statement. The new contributions include a sample of 15 species from Sudan, consisting of several varieties of sorghum - a plant that is significant both for the country's food security and its cultural heritage, the Crop Trust said. The war between the Rapid Support Forces and the army which broke out in April 2023 has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced 12 million, while plunging half of Sudan into hunger and several locations into famine. \"In Sudan...these seeds represent hope,\" the director of Sudan's Agricultural Plant Genetic Resources Conservation and Research Centre said in a statement. The total of 14,022 new samples will be deposited at 1430 GMT, including seeds of Nordic tree species from Sweden and rice from Thailand, the Crop Trust said. Sign up here.

REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab NEW YORK, Feb 24 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Apple (AAPL.O) , opens new tab has mastered the art of hyping the ho-hum. The iPhone maker’s semi-regular product presentations carry on a mystique created by late founder Steve Jobs, even when the updates are rather ordinary. Boss Tim Cook is borrowing the approach for his latest $500 billion reveal. The figure, unveiled , opens new tab on Monday, represents the amount Apple intends to spend in the United States over the next four years. It includes everything from hiring 20,000 workers to building a server factory in Houston to funding blockbuster films for its streaming service. Half a trillion dollars sprinkled around the country is also the sort of commitment that can buy some goodwill with President Donald Trump. Many such announcements tend to be flimsy or ephemeral. Foxconn’s plan to build a $10 billion plant and create 13,000 jobs in Wisconsin, rolled out in 2017 after Trump first took office, is the archetype of the genre. The Taiwanese manufacturer later dramatically scaled back the project. A promised $500 billion artificial intelligence initiative from OpenAI, SoftBank (9984.T) , opens new tab and Oracle (ORCL.N) , opens new tab has the potential to go the same way. Apple’s blueprint, is more plausible. In 2021, it said , opens new tab it would allocate $430 billion to the U.S. over five years and is on track to do so. On that basis, Apple has gone from earmarking about $85 billion a year to about $125 billion, or increase domestic spending about 10% annually. The rate is roughly the same as recent growth for operating costs and investment, with a bit more thrown in to bring some production home. Although it would be a healthy outlay, it pales compared to some other technology splurges. For example, Microsoft's (MSFT.O) , opens new tab capital expenditure alone over roughly the next four years is expected to be some $400 billion, according to Visible Alpha, more than twice as much as during the previous four. Similarly, Apple’s latest hiring pledge is the same as the ones it made in both 2018 , opens new tab and 2021. Why make such a big deal of what’s mostly business as usual? For one thing, Apple is more vulnerable than peers to intensifying trade wars. About 15% of its nearly $400 billion in revenue in the year to September 28 came from China, which is also a big manufacturing hub for its devices. Higher tariffs probably would mean higher U.S. prices for its gadgets, while any retaliation would threaten sales in China. Although Apple’s financial update is largely incremental, creating a little buzz, in the White House at least, may yet generate some substance. Follow @rob_cyran , opens new tab on X CONTEXT NEWS Apple said on February 24 that it would spend more than $500 billion in the United States over the next four years and hire at least 20,000 people, mostly to work in research, software development and artificial intelligence. The spending commitment includes payments to suppliers, direct employment, Apple data centers, corporate facilities and Apple TV+ production. It also earmarks $5 billion for its U.S. manufacturing fund, which will double its size. As part of the package, Apple said it would be working with partners to open a 250,000-square-foot facility to assemble servers in Houston in 2026.

REUTERS/Aly Song Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Companies Alibaba Group Holding Ltd Follow BYD Co Ltd Follow NVIDIA Corp Follow Show more companies HONG KONG, Feb 25 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Artificial intelligence will play a critical role in shaping China's fortunes as a great power. Yet Beijing’s attempt to translate wins by today’s innovators like DeepSeek and others into wider gains for the $18 trillion economy will be challenged not just by the United States but also by the Chinese Communist Party’s own desire to maintain control. Technological revolutions have underpinned history's great power transitions. Just as the United States supplanted the industrial dominance of the British empire in the 20th century through widespread adoption of electricity, machinery and motor vehicles, AI offers a similar opportunity for China to shift the balance of power in its own favour. Whether Chinese leader Xi Jinping aims to displace America in technology or economic or military terms is an ongoing subject of debate , opens new tab in Washington. Mike Waltz, national security adviser to the U.S. President Donald Trump, reckons America and China are in a cold war, though Beijing’s 2017 \"New Generation Artificial Intelligence Plan” simply calls for the People’s Republic to establish itself as a world AI leader and innovator by 2030. If there is a battlefield, Hangzhou-based DeepSeek is opening a new front. Its AI training models are groundbreaking and perform as well as those of Western rivals like OpenAI at a fraction of the cost. It’s the latest sign, along with similar offerings from Alibaba (9988.HK) , opens new tab , Tencent (0700.HK) , opens new tab and peers, that China can lead on innovation to close the gap with the $27 trillion U.S. economy. To that end, Xi is mobilising his corporate troops. In a rare and highly choreographed meeting last week he urged the chiefs of homegrown innovators such as BYD (002594.SZ) , opens new tab , (1211.HK) , opens new tab the world’s top electric vehicle maker, and telecoms conglomerate Huawei, which is leading China’s efforts to develop high-end chips to rival California-based Nvidia (NVDA.O) , opens new tab , to \"show their talent\". The successes of DeepSeek and Xi’s show of support for private sector has pushed Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Tech Index (.HSTECH) , opens new tab up by more than a quarter since the start of the year, outperforming the Nasdaq. Line chart comparing the performance of the Hang Seng Tech Index and the Nasdaq 100 since the start of the year Yet sustaining its AI advances will require a big effort. Like the United States and others, China needs to invest huge sums to build out physical infrastructure – including for power generation. It will also need to keep overcoming Washington’s latest measures blocking its access to cutting-edge chips and chipmaking equipment. The next hurdle may prove to be the hardest to clear, though. For gains to be broad-based, China will need the technology to be adopted and integrated across industries. Here, China may run into a “diffusion deficit”, a term used by Jeffrey Ding, a U.S.-based political science professor. In his recent book, \"Technology and the Rise of Great Powers: How Diffusion Shapes Economic Competition\", Ding argues that countries with weak “skill infrastructure” - institutions that help widen the base of new skills - tend to struggle to implement and disseminate innovations across an array of sectors. He concludes that policymakers in Washington are too focused on innovation, rather than diffusion, and may be overestimating China's rise as science and technology superpower. The People’s Republic, for example, boasts one of the largest pools of engineers and scientists in the world but fourth-year computer science majors in the United States \"substantially\" outperform peers in top universities in China. Ding's analysis of Japan during the 1980s and 1990s provides a cautionary tale on how this could morph into a big disadvantage. Japanese firms once controlled global computer and chip production, but the country suffered from a talent gap with the United States; annual inflows of skilled workers into the American information, communication and technology labour pool outpaced those in Japan by 68% in 1995; by 2001, this gap had widened to 300%. This, among other things, contributed to low growth and poor productivity in many sectors. Area chart showing China's patent applications have surpassed the US by far Indeed, Chinese businesses are laggards when it comes to adopting technologies. According to a domestic survey , opens new tab last year, more than 60% of 500 small and medium sized enterprises polled are only in the \"early\" stages of digitisation, using basic data management and IT applications. Less than a fifth of Chinese companies that responded to a separate survey said , opens new tab they had integrated generative AI into their business processes, trailing the United States by five percentage points. Some of the diffusion problem can be explained by the Chinese Communist Party’s desire to protect itself. China has access to vast amounts of data required to train AI models but the People’s Republic requires these models to “adhere to core socialist values” and exclude content that “endangers national security”. Strict censorship may have already slowed the country’s progress: In 2017, Tencent shut down an AI-powered chatbot installed on its messaging app after it uttered a political faux pas. Meanwhile, China’s top-down policy of identifying specific industries to back has produced some winners but it has also resulted in many inefficient enterprises that often have little incentive to take risks or try out new technologies; industrial planning has also led to a massive misallocation of capital. Between 2009 to 2018, growth in China's total factor productivity - an indicator of an economy's efficiency and competitiveness - significantly slowed , opens new tab to 0.7%, from the 2.8% in the decade before the global financial crisis, a sharper deceleration than world productivity growth. The Line chart shows China's productivity growth slowed significantly compared to the U.S. Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate AI could lift productivity growth in China by 8% over the next decade. That lags the United States, where the bank estimates AI will unlock , opens new tab a 15% boost or roughly $4.5 trillion of annual GDP gains. The difference comes down to diffusion: half of China’s jobs are in manufacturing, construction and other sectors less likely to use AI, per Goldman. Of course, it is still early days in the field and Beijing’s big push to develop other parts of its economy means China could benefit much more from AI than is currently envisioned. To go beyond the innovation phase, though, China probably needs to give its schools and private companies a freer hand.

REUTERS/Hannah McKay Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab LONDON, Feb 25 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Unilever’s (ULVR.L) , opens new tab new CEO may want to awaken animal spirits at the seller of Dove soap and Axe deodorant. On Tuesday , opens new tab , the $139 billion London-listed group announced that CEO Hein Schumacher is leaving the business after less than two years in charge. His replacement, finance boss Fernando Fernandez, is tasked with revitalising a company with a so-so portfolio of brands. One option may be to revisit a megadeal in the mould of Unilever’s attempted Haleon (HLN.L) , opens new tab purchase in 2022 , opens new tab . Schumacher’s departure looks both abrupt and messy. The Dutch executive is the company’s third CEO in roughly six years. Unilever has whipsawed between championing environmental, social and governance goals under previous bosses Paul Polman and Alan Jope, to doing the opposite under Schumacher, who said the company should no longer be “force fitting” purpose on all the group’s brands. For now, it looks like Fernandez will carry on with Schumacher’s plan to cut costs and focus the company’s marketing spend on 30 so-called “power brands”, referring to relatively well-known products like Comfort fabric softener, Hellmann's mayonnaise, and Knorr stock cubes. However, he may need some fresh thinking before long. Unilever is struggling to boost the volume of goods it sells. Schumacher warned earlier this month , opens new tab that there was a slowdown of market growth in 2024 that would continue in the near term. The consumer-goods group’s valuation reflects investors’ worries. Unilever trades at 17 times forward earnings - a discount to both Danone (DANO.PA) , opens new tab and Nestlé (NESN.S) , opens new tab , compared with a premium for much of 2024. A line chart showing that Unilever's price-earnings multiple has dipped below its consumer-goods rivals in recent weeks, compared with a premium in much of 2024 Closing that gap will mean turbocharging sales and the operating margin. Doing so will be hard with many of the group’s staler current brands. Fernandez may therefore need to be bold. He could look at buying a fast-growing, high-margin business like $30 billion Galderma (GALD.S) , opens new tab . Another option would be to revisit Advil painkiller-maker Haleon, which Unilever attempted to buy for 50 billion pounds ($63 billion) in 2022. The now-listed business is currently worth 36 billion pounds. Either of these possible deals would help to accelerate Unilever’s shift away from lower-valued food and towards the more prized beauty and healthcare businesses. If Fernandez focuses just on the company’s existing brands, there is a danger that sales will flounder. Dove, Sunsilk shampoo, Knorr and many others are vulnerable to competition from grocers’ cheaper products, making it tough to generate the kind of improvements that investors are seeking. Mega-M&A is always risky, but for Unilever so is doing nothing. Follow @aimeedonnellan , opens new tab on X CONTEXT NEWS Unilever said on February 25 that CEO Hein Schumacher would step down after less than two years in the job. Finance chief Fernando Fernandez will take over on March 1. Unilever, which owns Hellmann's mayonnaise and Dove soap, said there was no change to its 2025 outlook or medium-term forecast and that the board was committed to \"further accelerating\" Schumacher's growth plan. Shares in Unilever were down 1.9% as of 0958 GMT on February 25. For more insights like these, click here , opens new tab to try Breakingviews for free.

FIFA awarded the 2034 tournament to Saudi Arabia in an uncontested process in December , which also saw Spain, Portugal and Morocco chosen as the main hosts for the 2030 tournament combined with one-off matches in South America. However, the decisions have come under fire, with the 2030 plan criticised by climate activists because of the increased emissions necessitated by the extra travel across three continents. The 2034 bid by Saudi Arabia has been questioned by some in the game due to its desert climate and also been criticised by activists over the country's human rights record, much in the same way as the 2022 Qatar World Cup. Saudi Arabia denies suppressing rights. This left 2038 as the next available date for England to host its second World Cup after winning the tournament at home in 1966. Blatter said he was concerned about the increased influence of the Middle East on sports like football and Formula 1, with both having been heavily invested in by countries in the region, but said England should still apply to host the World Cup. \"They should wake up and apply again,\" the 88-year-old said. Blatter, who left FIFA in disgrace following a corruption scandal in 2015, was also concerned about the expanding size of the World Cup, which he said was diluting the quality of the tournament. Next year's event in the United States, Mexico and Canada has been expanded to 48 teams, up from 32 at the 2022 edition. \"It's become too big,\" he said. \"Will it become like in grand slam tennis where everybody goes to the World Cup? What next - 128 teams? \"I've always said there are too many teams and the quality is not the same,\" Blatter added. \"Who loses out – the spectators.\" He feared constant expansion could eventually damage the sport. \"As long as football has 2 billion followers, then FIFA thinks they are happy,\" the Swiss said. \"But one day there will be a stop – you cannot go and develop more football, and more players and have more money and more spectators and more stadiums.\" Sign up here.

Haaland, who has 27 goals this season in all competitions, suffered a knee injury in City's 4-0 victory over Newcastle on February 15 and was not named for Sunday's 2-0 loss at home to Liverpool , which left City fourth on 44 points. \"Tonight we will know after training,\" Guardiola told reporters on Tuesday of Haaland's prospects of playing against Spurs. \"I hope so, but we don't know yet. He feels better but we will see tomorrow.\" City won the league for the last four seasons but have failed to impress in this one, also crashing out of the Champions League with a humbling 6-3 aggregate defeat to Real Madrid. They spent over $224 million in the January window to sign Omar Marmoush, Nico Gonzalez, Abdukodir Khusanov, Vitor Reis and Juma Bah, but those players have not yet righted the ship. Despite their struggles, Guardiola said rebuilding City's squad would not be the biggest challenge of his career, given he had renewed the team several times in the last nine years. \"We have done it two or three times already. It is not the biggest challenge,\" he said. \"The challenge I had is when I was starting my managerial career with my staff. I proved myself and my staff proved we can do it.\" The Spanish manager also praised the performances of academy graduate Rico Lewis, who has frequently started at right back for the club since the departure of Kyle Walker to AC Milan. \"Since he arrived in the first team he has been really good. He is not a good defender but he is an exceptional defender. He is so smart and intelligent,\" Guardiola said. \"His physicality is not like a typical defender in this country but he is really good, especially with the ball.\" Sign up here.

So that tells you the resilience, resources, the ambition the team has.\" Arteta said that in the 15 matches prior to the loss to West Ham, Arsenal had won the exact same number of points as Liverpool. \"We got that defeat and on top of that, they win... it was a hard one to take,\" the former Arsenal midfielder said. \"The reality is, there's so many games to play. And you have to get back to it. And we have the levels, the consistency and the hunger to go again. And that's what we're going to do on Wednesday. \"At the end you have certain numbers you have to hit to win in this league and we have to hit that number if we're going to have any chance.\" Sign up here.

REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Summary Blatter and Platini face appeal from Swiss Federal Prosecutors Pair were cleared of fraud at 2022 hearing Blatter confident his acquittal will be upheld Platini's lawyer says client is confident of being cleared again ZURICH, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Sepp Blatter, the former head of soccer's global governing body FIFA, is looking forward to clearing his name at a new court hearing into allegations he made corrupt payments to French footballing great Michel Platini. Blatter, who was president of FIFA from 1998 to 2015, told Reuters on Tuesday he was innocent and the victim of a witch hunt ahead of the appeals hearing which starts on Monday. The 88-year-old is due to appear in court in Switzerland alongside former France captain and manager Platini, once seen as his eventual successor at the top of world football. Both were cleared in 2022 at a lower Swiss court following a seven-year investigation into a payment of 2 million Swiss francs ($2.24 million), a decision contested by Swiss prosecutors. \"The Federal Criminal Court in 2022 said the contract between Platini and me was correct, and I expect the new court will confirm this first decision,\" Blatter told Reuters, adding the upcoming appeal was \"absolute nonsense\". \"It's a witch hunt against me, it feels like a vendetta,\" Blatter added. \"I am completely confident I will be cleared, I am an honest man.\" The case goes back to a payment FIFA made to Platini when he was boss of European football's governing body UEFA in 2011, with Blatter's approval, for work done 10 years earlier. In the 2022 case, a judge said the pair's account of a 'gentlemen's agreement' for FIFA to pay Platini 2 million Swiss francs for consulting work between 1998 and 2002 was credible, and that serious doubts existed about the prosecution's allegation that it was a fraudulent payment. \"The payment was made based on a contract and the first court agreed,\" said Blatter. \"It was correctly implemented and there was no bribery in any way.\" Platini, a three-times European footballer of the year, also denies the fraud charges \"100%\" said his lawyer Dominic Nellen. The 69-year-old Frenchman, who after hanging up his boots helped organise the 1998 World Cup in his homeland, was confident he would be cleared again, Nellen said. \"My client was clearly acquitted by the court of first instance. It is incomprehensible the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland has appealed the case,\" Nellen told Reuters. As a result of the investigation, Blatter and Platini both lost their jobs and were banned from the sport for several years. In the upcoming Swiss hearing, federal prosecutors are seeking sentences of 20 months against both Blatter and Platini, suspended for two years. The proceedings, due to take place at the Extraordinary Appeals Chamber of the Swiss Criminal Court, will start in Muttenz, near Basel on Monday, with a verdict expected on March 25. Blatter said he was looking forward to putting the case behind him, adding he was happy following international matches on television and local games in his home canton of Valais. \"I truly hope this ends the matter,\" Blatter said. \"I'll be happy when everything is over and I can live in peace.\" ($1 = 0.8930 Swiss francs) Sign up here.

On Monday, United announced they would cut 150-200 jobs as part of an overhaul to return to profitability after five years of losses, in addition to 250 jobs removed last year. The club has been restructuring and cutting costs since British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe took a 25% stake last year. \"We have to address all the problems in the club but one important piece is how we got into this situation. It has to do a lot with the lack of success of the football team,\" Amorim told reporters ahead of Wednesday's Premier League match at home against Ipswich Town. \"We are the engine of the club. I want to help the team with my job which is to help the team, help the players and the success. \"It's always hard for everybody. They see their friends and teammates losing their jobs but again, I have to focus on what I can do to help the club in this moment and we as a club have to understand what we did wrong to get in this situation.\" United have endured a torrid season and a three-match winless run in the Premier League has left them 15th in the standings. Asked if the negativity surrounding the club would make it harder for players to perform, Amorim said: \"It's hard enough to win football matches. \"This year has been really hard for everybody because as a club we have had a lot of changes. If you have a football club that is playing well and winning games, it is easier for the fans and everybody to feel the changes. \"In this moment, we are in a difficult period inside the club and on the pitch. We have to do our job and try our best to help the team to perform better.\" ($1 = 0.7899 pounds) Sign up here.

Billed by Syria's Islamist rulers as a key milestone following the end of decades of Assad family rule, the conference was attended by hundreds of Syrians who met at the so-called People's Palace in the hills above the capital. The closing statement, read out after a day of workshops, called for upholding freedom of expression as a value Syrians have \"paid for with their blood\" and preserving \"peaceful coexistence between all components of Syrian society\". The statement made no mention of a role for religion in the state, other than saying public positions should not be influenced by sectarian or ethnic quotas. The participating parties called for Syria's territorial integrity to be upheld, they condemned an Israeli incursion, and said Western sanctions imposed on the country should be lifted. Proponents hailed the one-day event as an unprecedented forum for free expression at the former centre of ousted President Bashar al-Assad's power, though critics fear it may be window dressing for a transition process steered heavily by Syria's new leaders. Syria's political roadmap remains broadly undefined, save for a new transitional government set to take power on March 1. Its members have yet to be announced. The summit was closely watched by Arab and Western capitals alike, which have conditioned full ties with Syria's new leaders - including the possible lifting of sanctions - on whether the political process is inclusive of Syria's ethnically and religiously diverse population, three diplomats said. CONCERNS Participants said the discussions were well-organised - but they still had concerns over how much their input would count in a political process heavily controlled thus far by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Islamist group that toppled Assad. \"Our eyes remain on two things: that this discussion needs to be an ongoing process, and that we need to know how these discussions will be used,\" Hanin Ahmad, an activist from the central province of Homs, told Reuters. Ahmad participated in the session on personal freedoms, where she said there was broad consensus on protecting the civic, political and individual liberties of Syrians. \"We feel we're trying to rebuild Syria from scratch,\" said Adnan Tarabishy, a Syrian businessman who took part in the economy session.

We must take advantage of every moment of it to serve the interests of our people and our country,\" he said. Participants divided into six working groups to discuss a transitional justice system; the constitution; building state institutions; personal freedoms; Syria's future economic model and the role civil society would have in the country. The discussions were confidential, with a moderator allocating two minutes to participants to speak and restrictions on removing any documents from the summit hall. Organisers say the final declaration will help shape a constitutional process intended to lay out the basic principles for Syria's new governing order and will be considered by the new transitional government. Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry welcomed the conference and said it hoped the event would bolster Syrian national unity. Syria-based diplomats were not invited to the conference, three foreign envoys in the country said. Its organisers did not take up offers by the United Nations to help with the summit. SANCTIONS The U.N., the United States and other countries have imposed sanctions on HTS as a group. The U.S. and the European Union also have widespread sanctions in place on Syria, but have issued temporary lifts on some sectors in recent weeks. Speaking after Sharaa, Syria's Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani criticised the sanctions, saying they were being used \"as a means of pressure\" on the Syrian people. Following his comments, a woman in attendance stood up and shouted, \"Thank God, the People's Palace has returned to the people!\" Five members of the seven-strong preparatory committee are either in HTS or close to the group, and there are no Druze or Alawite members, both of which are significant minorities in Syria. No members of the Kurdish-led autonomous administration in northeast Syria or the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces were invited, officials from both groups told Reuters. Sign up here.

Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Read more Summary Hamas-Israel ceasefire in force since January 19 First phase of ceasefire due to end on Saturday Israel trying to bring home remaining 63 hostages Phase two to focus on final end to war, Gaza governance U.S. envoy Witkoff expected in Israel on Wednesday JERUSALEM/DOHA, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Israel is considering an extension of the 42-day truce in Gaza as it seeks to bring home the remaining 63 hostages, while putting off agreement on the future of the enclave for now, Israeli officials said. The initial phase of the ceasefire deal , launched with the backing of the United States and the help of Egyptian and Qatari mediators on January 19, is due to end on Saturday and it remains unclear what will follow. \"We are being very cautious,\" Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Sharren Haskel told reporters in Jerusalem, when asked whether the truce might be extended without the start of talks on a second phase which would include difficult issues such as a final end to the war and the future governance of Gaza. \"There wasn't a particular agreement on that, but it might be a possibility,\" she said. \"We didn't close the option of continuing the current ceasefire, but in return for our hostages, and they have to be returned safely.\" If no agreement is reached by Friday, officials expect either a return to fighting or a freeze in the current situation in which the truce would continue but hostages would not return and Israel may block the entry of aid into Gaza. Two officials who have been involved in the ceasefire process told Reuters that Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas have not engaged in negotiations to finalise an agreement over phase two of the ceasefire which will have to bridge wide gaps between the two sides to be concluded. \"I think it's unrealistic to see something like that forming within a few days,\" Haskel said. \"This is something that needs to be discussed in depth. This is going to take time.\" The deal, which included the release of 33 Israeli hostages in return for some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees held in Israeli jails and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from some of their positions in Gaza, has survived numerous hiccups. So far, 29 Israeli hostages - plus five Thais - have been released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees, with the bodies of four more hostages, initially due to be handed over on Thursday, still to come. There is now a standoff over the release of more than 600 Palestinians , which Israel has delayed, accusing Hamas of breaching the agreement by making a public show of the handover of Israeli hostages in Gaza. Hamas official Basem Naim said progress could not be made while the prisoners were still being held but that Hamas was committed to a permanent ceasefire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces. Haskel said she hoped a solution would be found to secure the handover of the final four in the next few days. WITKOFF DUE IN ISRAEL Steve Witkoff , U.S. President Donald Trump's special Middle East envoy, is expected in Israel on Wednesday to continue discussions on the second stage, opening the way to a final end to the war in Gaza. Negotiations over the second phase, intended to secure the release of the remaining hostages and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, had been meant to start this month, 16 days after the start of the truce. Qatar's prime minister flew to Florida on February 6 and met Witkoff to discuss the \"full implementation\" of phase one and \"to kick-start negotiations for the second phase\", according to an official briefed on the talks. But officials in the ceasefire process say that so far none of the principal negotiators have met face to face since the first phase was agreed last month and there is little clarity on options for the \"day after\". \"This is the day after Gaza, after the war in Gaza and what's going to happen there, and so we are continuing that channel with the Americans,\" Haskel said. The fighting in Gaza was triggered by a Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023, in which Israel said about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken as hostages back to Gaza. Israel's retaliatory assault on Gaza has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, Palestinian health officials say, and laid waste to much of the enclave. Israel has said Hamas cannot have any role in the future running of Gaza and has rejected a role for the Palestinian Authority. Hamas has said it will not necessarily demand that it remain in charge of the enclave, which it has governed since 2007, but that it must be consulted. Arab states, which are likely to have to shoulder much of the financial burden of rebuilding devastated Gaza, have been struggling to come up with a proposal of their own but are expected to demand a role for the Palestinian Authority. Uncertainty increased after Trump proposed moving all the Palestinians out of Gaza to make way for a U.S. waterfront development project, a plan that was endorsed by the Israeli cabinet but rejected by Arab states and Palestinians.

REUTERS/Stephani Spindel/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Summary Hostage Noa Argamani was rescued by Israeli forces Future of Gaza ceasefire deal unclear UN Mideast envoy says 'undeniable' trauma on both sides UNITED NATIONS, Feb 25 (Reuters) - An Israeli woman kidnapped by Hamas Palestinian militants recounted her ordeal at the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday, telling the 15-member body she did not think she would make it out alive, and pleading for a ceasefire to continue. Noa Argamani was rescued by Israeli forces in June last year, eight months after she and her partner were taken by Hamas from a music festival in southern Israel. Her partner, Avinatan Or, is still held hostage and due to be released during the second phase of a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. The initial phase of the ceasefire deal , launched on January 19, is due to end on Saturday with dozens of hostages having been released in return for hundreds of Palestinian detainees and convicts held by Israel. Negotiators have not fully resolved the steps to follow in later phases. Hamas still holds dozens of hostages. \"I need to make sure that the world knows that: the deal must go on in full ... completely, in all the stages,\" she told the Security Council before then describing how a house she was held hostage in was blown up, trapping her in the rubble. \"I couldn't move, I couldn't breathe - I thought it's going to be the last seconds of my life,\" said Argamani, adding that she received no medical help from Hamas. \"Being here with you today is a miracle.\" U.N. Middle East envoy Sigrid Kaag, who is also the senior U.N. humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza, told the Security Council that a resumption of hostilities in the Palestinian enclave \"must be avoided at all costs.\" \"The trauma is undeniable on both sides,\" she said. \"In my last visit to Gaza, soon after the ceasefire came into effect, I was once again moved by a sense of utter devastation ... and despair due to loss, trauma and a sense of abandonment.\" FUTURE OF GAZA Hamas-led fighters killed 1,200 people and captured more than 250 hostages in an attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, according to Israeli tallies. An Israeli retaliatory assault has since laid waste to most of Gaza and killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health officials. Israel has said its goals are to eliminate Hamas, bring home all the hostages and secure the safety and future of Israel. \"Hamas must be eliminated,\" acting U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Dorothy Shea told the council. \"Any plan for reconstruction in Gaza must ensure Hamas is fully removed from power and held accountable for its Oct. 7 terrorist massacre.\" \"We look forward to a plan from our Arab partners on the future of Gaza that reflects this vision,\" she said. Daniel Levy, president of the U.S./Middle East Project think tank, told the Security Council that ending Hamas governance in Gaza was achievable. But he said no party to a conflict would negotiate its own dissolution unless it were destroyed on the battlefield or the root causes of the conflict were addressed. \"Hamas has not been defeated, and there will be resistance as long as there is the structural violence of occupation and apartheid, it is that simple,\" Levy said. Israel withdrew soldiers and settlers from Gaza in 2005. The territory has been ruled by Hamas since 2007 but is still considered to be under Israeli occupation by the United Nations.

{"url": "https://www.reuters.com/graphics/GAZA-WASTE/egpblkaagpq/", "text": "Skip to main content World Business Legal Markets Breakingviews More Gaza’s garbage crisis After 15 months of war, Gaza is suffering from a destroyed waste system. As the cleanup begins, the impacts on its people’s health and land will be long felt. By Chinmay Pathak and Jitesh Chowdhury Published Feb. 24, 2025 01:05 PM GMT+5:30 More than a year of conflict has crippled the already limited waste collection infrastructure in Gaza. With access to designated landfills blocked and no transport due to a fuel blockade imposed by Israel, hundreds of thousands of tons of solid waste has piled up in the streets. Even before the war, Gaza faced severe waste management challenges, generating 1,700 tons of waste daily, with only three operational but overcrowded landfills. One of the sites, Johr Edeek, operated beyond capacity, with waste piling up to 35 meters high, according to a report from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). However, despite the strains, a structure was in place, with towns and cities sending waste to the three landfill sites. Limited resources caused frequent fires and environmental risks. From 2017 to 2022, the number of waste collection vehicles dropped to 73 from 112, with ageing equipment struggling to meet the needs of the growing population. The war has worsened the crisis, destroying waste collection vehicles, facilities, and medical waste treatment centers, leaving municipalities overwhelmed. Pre-war The solid waste removal network previously relied on three main landfills, all closed during the latest conflict. The distribution of Gaza’s population has also changed dramatically, with over 60% of buildings likely damaged or destroyed, forcing many to relocate closer to humanitarian zones. The closure of the three main landfills by the Israel Defense Forces has also forced local authorities to find temporary dumpsites. Post-war At least 225 temporary waste dumps were operating across the Gaza strip, as of May 2024. These waste dumps were identified through an analysis of open-source information including satellite imagery, social media posts and official reports. It is suspected that many more such dumps could exist. The impact of trash piles The silent threat of accumulated and improperly handled waste is made worse in a conflict zone that is also plagued by high temperatures, destroyed sanitary infrastructure and a population weakened by food scarcity and lack of medical attention. The United Nations has repeatedly warned of the public health and environmental crisis arising from widespread pollution caused by solid waste in Gaza. A key issue is the leachate, a polluted liquid that results when water filters through layers of accumulated waste in improperly managed garbage piles, posing a risk when it infiltrates soil and contaminates groundwater. While cleanup efforts have been attempted at various points throughout the war, recent UNDP research warned that most of these efforts are localised in Gaza’s south, with only 600 to 700 tons of waste collected daily. This barely covers the estimated 2,000 tons of waste generated every day. Living near rotting trash Most of Gaza’s displaced people — communities sheltering in refugee camps or makeshift areas — have been forced to live near the piles of rotting garbage. No early relief for their plight is in sight, despite a ceasefire signed by Israel and Hamas in January. “We can’t sleep, we can’t eat, we can’t drink. The smell is killing us,” said Ahmed Shaloula, originally from Gaza City but now one of many displaced Palestinians living in Khan Younis. Al-Aqsa University in Khan Younis Gaza’s oldest educational institution, Al-Aqsa University was first established in 1955, with its first campus in Gaza City. Its second campus, located in Khan Younis, was built in the past decade. It’s this campus that has now become the home of many displaced people, with the campus’ surroundings converted into a makeshift waste field. The waste dump stretches over 300 metres and is estimated to cover nearly 10,000 square metres. Satellite images: Planet Labs Nuseirat Camp A waste dump near the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza can also be seen in satellite images. Satellite images: Planet Labs Disease and ailments A landfill in a public area in Central Gaza, shown in the video below, has become part of the grim reality for many Palestinians residing nearby. Abou Mohammed, a Palestinian, who lives about 100-150 meters away from the landfill, says he is worried about the health of his children. “This waste here has brought diseases. Our children are suffering from various ailments that we have never seen before,” he said. The video shows a landfill in Central Gaza in May 2024. The video shows a landfill in Central Gaza in May 2024. The two photos are taken at other dump sites in Gaza. REUTERS Youssef Hammad, a municipality worker, also explained that the area was not originally designated for waste disposal. However, the conflict has given them little choice but to dump the waste there. “The municipality was compelled to urgently dispose of waste in this location due to the inability of municipal crews to access the official dumping grounds ... With the onset of the war, we were unable to reach these locations due to the lack of mechanisms of movement (for access) caused by road blockages,” said Hammad. Hammad also warned of the environmental hazard associated with such landfills. “These include stray dogs, the proliferation of insects, as well as environmental pollution and the degradation of the surrounding environment in this area,” he said. Abu Mazen Khatab, a displaced man living near the waste dump with his family, including six-month-old daughter, says he worries sewage water will soon seep into his tent. “If we don't die from the missiles; we will die from the sewage and the bad smells here and the waste.” Sources United Nations, Planet Labs Edited by Simon Scarr, Rebecca Pazos and William Maclean Site Index Latest Home Browse World Business Legal Markets Breakingviews Technology Investigations Lifestyle Media Videos Videos Pictures Pictures Gallery Graphics About Reuters About Reuters Careers Reuters News Agency Brand Attribution Guidelines Reuters Leadership Reuters Fact Check Reuters Diversity Report Stay Informed Download the App Newsletters Information you can trust Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

REUTERS/Gwladys Fouche/File Photo [1/5] A portrait of Russian Nobel Peace Prize laureate Andrei Sakharov hangs on the wall of the meeting room where the Norwegian Nobel Committee meets at the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo, Norway, January 3, 2025. REUTERS/Gwladys Fouche/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Summary Nobel nominations, related papers were secret for 50 years Sakharov asked Norwegian diplomats to help him smuggle out his speech Graphic of Nobel laureates: OSLO, Feb 25 (Reuters) - On a cold December morning in 1975, Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov met a Norwegian diplomat on a Moscow street to hand over his acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize , so his wife could read his words at the Oslo award ceremony he was forbidden to attend. Nuclear physicist Sakharov was one of the Soviet Union's most prominent dissidents, criticising the lack of human rights under Communist party rule, and the father of the Soviet hydrogen bomb who later campaigned against nuclear weapons. Authorities denied him the right to leave the country to receive the peace prize. Fifty years on, newly released papers reviewed by Reuters reveal for the first time how Sakharov smuggled the speech and his Nobel lecture to Norway. Days before the award ceremony in early December 1975, Norwegian diplomat Viggo Lange took a phone call in Norway's embassy in Moscow from \"a Russian\" eager to speak to him. \"It was Sakharov, asking whether he could come to the embassy before one o'clock,\" Lange wrote in a memo to the foreign ministry back in Oslo. \"He asked that someone met him outside in case he were prevented from entering.\" Lange recalls in the note: \"Well before one o'clock, I went outside and stood on the pavement outside the embassy's entrance. \"The (Russian) militia man in the street appeared to be waiting for something. After five minutes, he was called up and left, and about two minutes later, Sakharov arrived by chauffeured car (whose plates were MKZJ), which stopped on the other side of the street. \"Sakharov recognised me and I met him on the edge of the pavement on the embassy's side of the street. The militia man studied us with interest but did not give signs that he would intervene,\" Lange wrote. \"Sakharov carried with him the typewritten manuscript for his Nobel lecture and his acceptance speech for the award ceremony.\" Lange then called Norwegian ambassador Petter Graver, who joined Sakharov in the embassy's library. There, Sakharov asked Graver to ensure the documents be passed on to his wife, Yelena Bonner , who was in Western Europe at the time. Graver said he would, according to the memo. 'STATE AND MILITARY SECRETS' Bonner read her husband's words at the December 10 ceremony in the Norwegian capital. In the speech, Sakharov stated that Soviet authorities had denied his trip to Oslo on \"the alleged grounds that I am acquainted with state and military secrets\". Sakharov was awarded the prize \"for his struggle for human rights in the Soviet Union, for disarmament and cooperation between all nations\", according to the Nobel committee citation. The process of nominations to the Peace Prize remains secret for 50 years and documents about the prize awarded to Sakharov were made available on request this year. In 1980, Soviet authorities banished Sakharov to internal exile in Gorky, now Nizhny Novgorod, a city that was off-limits to foreigners, after his criticism of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Sakharov was released by Kremlin decree in 1986, after Mikhail Gorbachev came to power and introduced his policy of glasnost. He and Bonner resumed their lives in Moscow. Sakharov travelled to the West, including Paris, resumed his scientific work and was restored to official good standing, before he died in Moscow on December 14, 1989. Sign up here.

Zambada pleaded not guilty in federal court in New York last September to 17 felony counts including drug trafficking, money laundering and weapons charges. He has been jailed pending trial. \"Mr. Zambada does not want to go to trial and is willing to accept responsibility for a charge that does not include the death penalty,\" lawyer Frank Perez said. A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's office in Brooklyn, which brought the charges, declined to comment. Zambada, who is in his 70s, was taken into U.S. custody last July at a New Mexico airfield along with one of Guzman's sons, Joaquin Guzman Lopez, in a major coup for U.S. law enforcement.

REUTERS/Evan Buhler [1/5] Canada's Liberal Party leadership candidates, former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney, former Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, former House leader Karina Gould and former Liberal MP Frank Baylis stand next to each other before participating in a French language... Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Read more OTTAWA, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The leading candidates vying to replace Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spent considerable time during a televised debate on Monday discussing the need to stand up to U.S. President Donald Trump. The next election must be held by October 20 this year and until recently the official opposition Conservatives looked set for an easy win after more than nine years of Liberal rule. But the race now is much closer , thanks to Trump's threats to impose tariffs on all imports from Canada. \"Trump represents the biggest threat to Canada since World War Two,\" former finance minister Chrystia Freeland said during a two-hour French-language debate between the four candidates. Freeland, who helped negotiate the U.S.-Canada-Mexico trade deal during the first Trump administration, said the president at that point had vowed to wage economic war against Canada. \"But this time Trump's threats are worse - he wants to make Canada the 51st state,\" she added. Canada sends 75% of its goods and services exports to the United States and would be plunged into a recession if the tariffs persisted. Ex-central banker Mark Carney, who polls indicate is the front-runner, said Trump would never succeed in making good his threat to make Canada a part of the United States. \"At this moment Canada is facing the worst crisis of our lives ... I know how to handle crises,\" he said. Carney headed the Bank of Canada during the 2008-2009 financial meltdown and then the Bank of England during the Brexit vote. Carney and Freeland both say Canada needs to respond robustly to any Trump tariffs. Freeland's resignation last December after nine years in cabinet triggered a crisis that eventually forced Trudeau to announce last month that he would step down . The new leader will be named on March 9. The Conservatives, who say there is no difference between Trudeau and the two main leadership contenders, issued a news release earlier in the day entitled \"Sneaky Carney Must Come Clean With Canadians\". The two remaining candidates are former cabinet minister Karina Gould and retired Liberal legislator Frank Baylis. The four will hold a debate in English, the other of Canada's official languages, on Tuesday. Sign up here.

Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Read more GARDI SUGDUB ISLAND, Panama, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Dozens of Venezuelan migrants boarded small boats on an island off the Caribbean coast of Panama on Monday, setting off towards Colombia by sea as part of a reverse migration of families who have given up trying to reach the United States. At least six boats, each with more than a dozen people aboard, departed the island of Gardi Sugdub in the San Blas Archipelago off the coast of Panama, aiming to reach Playa Miel near the Colombian border. From there, the migrants explained that they planned to continue their southbound journey until arriving home in their native Venezuela. Fabiola Rodriguez, a Venezuelan migrant who reached Mexico but was unable to enter the United States, was among dozens who waited to board the small boats over the weekend. She said that a lack of clarity from Panamanian officials about repatriation options forced her and others to make their way home on their own, despite the costs and the dangers. A Venezuelan girl died over the weekend, after one of these boats shipwrecked with more than a dozen migrants on board, according to Panamanian authorities. Daniel Gonzalez, a Venezuelan man traveling with his wife, daughter, and niece, said that they would rather be in Venezuela than in another country in the region, such as Mexico or Costa Rica. On Sunday, he and his family waited at the port of Niga Kantule for a boat that would take them to Gardi Sugdub island. \"Of course, we wanted to reach the United States to have a better life,\" he said. \"But that wasn't possible.\" The reverse migration follows U.S. President Donald Trump's crackdown on unlawful migration, including a broad ban on asylum in addition to the elimination of his predecessor's humanitarian parole programs, which had offered some migrants legal pathways to enter the United States.

REUTERS/Kent Nishimura/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab BELGRADE, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Serbian police raided the offices of two Belgrade-based democracy watchdogs, seeking information about possible abuse of funds donated by the U.S. international aid agency (USAID), Nenad Stefanovic, a senior state prosecutor, said on Tuesday. The move came after the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump froze USAID funding for 90 days in January and has since sought to scale down the aid agency. NGOs, media and humanitarian projects worldwide have been affected, including those in southern and eastern European countries like Bosnia and Hungary . Stefanovic said prosecutors sought information from the U.S. following statements by Trump, State Secretary Marco Rubio, billionaire Elon Musk and other U.S. officials about the freeze of USAID funding. Stefanovic said the CRTA pollster and the watchdogs Civic Initiatives, Trag, and the Policy Center were under investigation following allegations by top U.S. officials about excessive spending of USAID funds. \"The (Serbian) Special Anti-Corruption Department... contacted the U.S. Justice Department for information concerning USAID over the abuse of funds, possible money laundering, and the improper spending of American taxpayers’ funds in Serbia,\" he said in a TV broadcast. Stefanovic added that the Higher Public Prosecutor's Office had ordered the confiscation of all documentation related to USAID from the four organisations and ordered interviews with individuals in charge of spending. Maja Stojanovic, executive director of Civic Initiatives, said around 20 detectives raided her organisation's offices without presenting a court order. \"Today's intrusion by the police... represents a brutal demonstration of force and continued pressure on civil society in Serbia,\" Stojanovic said. The raids came amid ongoing mass student protests against populist President Aleksandar Vucic and his government. Students, opposition parties and rights watchdogs accuse authorities loyal to Vucic and his Serbian Progressive Party of rampant corruption, bribing voters, stifling media freedom, violence against opponents, and ties with organised crime. Vucic and his allies deny the allegations. USAID has invested almost $1 billion in Serbia since 2001 to bolster growth, strengthen the rule of law and improve good governance, including donations to government bodies and parliament, as well as to a number of watchdogs and rights organisations.

Picture taken February 23, 2021 Octav Ganea/Inquam Photos via REUTERS/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab BUCHAREST, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Romania's three opposition far-right parties filed a motion of no confidence in the pro-European coalition government on Tuesday, a move likely to fail but also to boost the parties' public profile ahead of a re-run presidential election. The three parties won around 35% of seats in a Dec. 1 parliamentary election, capitalizing on popular anger with a centrist establishment mired in accusations of corruption. In their no-confidence motion, Romania's second largest party, the Alliance for Uniting Romanians (AUR), along with SOS Romania and the Young People's Party (POT), accused the two-month-old government of corruption and of losing credibility. Political analysts expect the Social Democrat-led coalition to survive the no-confidence vote but say it is another example of the far-right parties flexing their muscles as Romania girds for a rerun of a cancelled presidential election that a far-right NATO critic, Calin Georgescu , had looked set to win. The three parties' move to impeach President Klaus Iohannis, a centrist who remained in post in a caretaker capacity after the cancellation of the presidential election, prompted him to resign this month to avoid casting Romania into an extended foreign policy crisis and further boosting the far-right. The speaker of parliament is now acting head of state until the planned rerun of the presidential election in May. Last year's presidential contest was cancelled after Georgescu's victory in the first round on November 24 prompted accusations of Russian interference - denied by Moscow - that finally led to the annulment of the entire ballot. Members of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration have sharply criticised Romania for annulling its election. U.S. Vice President JD Vance said the cancellation meant Romania does not share American values, while billionaire Elon Musk labelled the chief judge of the top court that annulled the vote a \"tyrant\". Musk has previously reposted Georgescu's comments as well as podcasts by right-wing hosts such as Alex Jones that featured the Romanian politician. Georgescu, who has praised Romania's 1930s fascist leaders and expressed admiration for both the U.S. and Russian presidents, remains voters' top choice for the presidency, according to opinion polls.

REUTERS/Leah Millis/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Summary Biden issued memorandum amid criticism over Gaza war Order required reports on allies use of US arms US Senator calls Trump move 'shameful' WASHINGTON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The Trump administration has rescinded a Biden-era order that required it to report potential violations of international law involving U.S.-supplied weapons by allies including Israel, two U.S. officials and a source familiar with the decision said on Monday. The Washington Post first reported , opens new tab the decision, citing current and former officials, to scrap National Security Memorandum-20, which was signed by former President Joe Biden in February 2024 amid criticism over Israel's use of American bombs in its war in Gaza. The memorandum required the U.S. government to produce reports for Congress on the use of U.S. arms by other countries. In May 2024, in a report required by the memorandum, Biden's administration said Israel may have breached international humanitarian law but that U.S. officials were unable to identify specific instances of breaches that harmed civilians due to the chaos of war. The Trump administration would have been required in the coming months to report to Congress its own assessment of Israel's conduct. The Washington Post cited an order issued by White House national security adviser Michael Waltz on February 21 repealing NSM-20. Reuters was not able to independently confirm the existence of the order, but two U.S. officials and a source familiar with the move said they had been told the directive was revoked. The State Department referred questions to the White House, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, a key proponent of congressional oversight of U.S. arms sales, said the decision to revoke the memo was \"shameful.\" \"It’s a disservice to our national security, to global human rights, and to our standing around the world,\" Van Hollen said in a statement. \"This move also undermines American taxpayers’ right to ensure the use of their dollars aligns with our laws and our national interest. It’s another clear example of Trump’s blatant indifference to American values. This is not America first – it’s America in retreat.” NSM-20 applied to all countries involved in armed conflict that receive U.S. weapons, but sparked dissent among U.S. officials over whether Israel's assurances that it was using U.S.- supplied weapons in accordance with international humanitarian law were credible or reliable. After returning to office on January 20, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that called for a review of all national security memoranda issued under Biden. Sign up here.

REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Feb 24 (Reuters) - A second federal judge is facing a long-shot bid by a Republican lawmaker to have him impeached as conservative members of the U.S. House of Representatives ramp up public criticism of judges who rule against U.S. President Donald Trump 's agenda. Republican U.S. Representative Andy Ogles of Tennessee on Monday said he filed a resolution seeking to have U.S. District Judge John Bates in Washington, D.C., removed from office after he ordered the Trump administration to restore government health websites that were taken offline in response to an executive order requiring the removal of \"gender ideology extremism.\" Ogles' impeachment measure argued that Bates failed to consider that the webpages at issue maintained information about gender-affirming care and that the \"continued socialization of this grave moral evil necessitates immediate action against those who would promote it.\" Bates did not respond to a request for comment. The U.S. Constitution provides that the grounds for impeachment are treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. To remove a judge from office, the House must pass articles of impeachment by a simple majority vote and then the Senate must vote by at least a two-thirds majority to convict the judge. Republicans control both chambers of Congress but do not have a two-thirds majority in the Senate. But despite facing an unlikely path to success, a small group of House Republicans have in recent days have been ramping up calls to impeach judges who rule against Trump, formally moving to do so already with one other jurist, U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan. The impeachment resolutions were filed against Engelmayer after he temporarily blocked the Department of Government Efficiency, the government cost-cutting team spearheaded by billionaire Elon Musk, from accessing U.S. Treasury Department systems responsible for trillions of dollars in payments. Musk on Monday threw his support behind impeaching Bates, writing on X: \"Time to impeach judges who violate the law.\" The attacks against judges for their rulings and calls for impeachment have been sharply criticized by bar groups and law professors, including John Collins of George Washington University, who said that the effort \"smacks of intimidation.\" \"It's completely inappropriate,\" Collins said in an email. The ruling Bates issued came in a lawsuit by the liberal-leaning medical advocacy group Doctors for America, which said the sudden removal of websites by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration hampered doctors' and researchers' ability to fight disease. The webpages had been removed pursuant to an executive order Trump signed on his first day back in office on January 20 that directed the federal government to only recognize two, biologically distinct sexes, male and female. The February 11 ruling requiring the pages to be restored incensed Trump's allies, including Musk, who described Bates as \"corrupt\" and \"evil\" and called for his removal. Ogles' resolution alleged Bates, an appointee of Republican former President George W. Bush, \"has engaged in conduct so utterly lacking in intellectual honesty and basic integrity that he is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors.\" Read more: Republican lawmaker seeks US judge's impeachment over ruling against Trump Trump, allies ramp up attacks on judges as Musk calls for impeachments Trump administration ordered to restore removed CDC and FDA websites Sign up here.

Don Knight/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Summary Glossip was convicted of commissioning a 1997 murder Oklahoma's attorney general supported Glossip's appeal Supreme Court's 5-3 ruling authored by Justice Sotomayor WASHINGTON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court threw out Oklahoma death row inmate Richard Glossip's conviction for a 1997 murder-for-hire plot and granted him a new trial, concluding on Tuesday that prosecutors violated their constitutional duty to correct false testimony by their star witness. The justices, in a 5-3 ruling authored by liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, reversed a lower court's decision that had upheld Glossip's conviction and had allowed his planned execution to move forward despite his claim that prosecutors wrongly withheld evidence that could help his defense. Don Knight, an attorney for Glossip, called the ruling \"a victory for justice and fairness in our judicial system.\" \"We are thankful that a clear majority of the court supports long-standing precedent that prosecutors cannot hide critical evidence from defense lawyers and cannot stand by while their witnesses knowingly lie to the jury,\" Knight said. \"Rich Glossip, who has maintained his innocence for 27 years, will now be given the chance to have the fair trial that he has always been denied,\" Knight added. During Oct. 9 arguments in the case , the justices probed whether an Oklahoma court properly weighed newly revealed information that Glossip's lawyers said would have aided his defense and which the state's Republican attorney general, Gentner Drummond, called wrongly withheld by prosecutors. Drummond, a Republican, supported Glossip's appeal. Glossip's lawyers had asked the justices to throw out his conviction and grant him a new trial after the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals upheld his death sentence despite potentially exculpatory evidence being found in an independent investigation ordered by Drummond. Drummond said on Tuesday that in deciding how to proceed in the case his office will \"determine the most appropriate course of action to ensure justice is secured for all involved.\" Glossip, now 62, was convicted of commissioning the murder of Barry Van Treese, owner of the Best Budget Inn motel in Oklahoma City where Glossip was a manager. All parties agree Van Treese was fatally beaten with a baseball bat by maintenance worker Justin Sneed, who eventually became the star witness for the prosecution. Sneed, who was a methamphetamine addict, confessed to the murder but avoided capital punishment by accepting a plea deal that involved testifying that Glossip paid him $10,000 to do it. Glossip admitted to helping Sneed cover up the murder after it occurred, but denied knowing Sneed planned to kill Van Treese or encouraging him to do so. The evidence disclosed in 2023 by Drummond - including a prosecutor's hand-written notes from a meeting with Sneed - cast doubt on Sneed's credibility, according to Glossip's lawyers. They said they were kept in the dark about Sneed receiving psychiatric treatment for bipolar disorder immediately after his arrest, and that prosecutors failed to correct Sneed's false statement about his prescription for the medication lithium. 'FAILURE TO CORRECT' Sotomayor was joined in the decision by the court's two other liberal members as well as by conservative Justices John Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh. Sotomayor emphasized that Sneed's testimony had been indispensable to prosecutors, noting that \"no other witness and no physical evidence established that Glossip orchestrated Van Treese's murder.\" \"Thus, the jury could convict Glossip only if it believed Sneed,\" Sotomayor wrote. Sotomayor cited the court's 1959 decision in a case called Napue v. Illinois, which held that a conviction secured through the knowing use of false evidence violates the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment provision protecting the right to due process. \"We conclude that the prosecution's failure to correct Sneed's trial testimony violated the Due Process Clause,\" Sotomayor wrote. Justice Clarence Thomas, in a 44-page dissent joined by fellow conservative Justice Samuel Alito, accused the court's majority of stretching the law at every turn to rule in Glossip's favor. Thomas called Sneed's testimony about his medical condition \"patently immaterial.\" Conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett, in a partial dissent, said the court was wrong to set aside Glossip's conviction and instead should have returned the case to a lower court for further proceedings. Drummond became an unlikely ally of Glossip in the case. Although Drummond has previously said he believes Glossip's role in covering up Van Treese's murder made him at least an \"accessory after the fact,\" justifying a long prison sentence, his murder conviction was too flawed to defend. \"I have long maintained that I do not believe Mr. Glossip is innocent, but it is now an undeniable fact that he did not receive a fair trial,” Drummond said after Tuesday's ruling. Justice Neil Gorsuch did not participate in the case, apparently because he dealt with the matter while earlier serving on a lower court. The Supreme Court in 2023 halted Glossip's scheduled execution while his appeal proceeded. Sign up here.

REUTERS/Thomas Peter/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab HONG KONG, Feb 25 (Reuters) - China aims to effectively eliminate severe air pollution by the end of 2025, a senior environment official said, as authorities ramp up efforts in pollution control and emissions reduction in the \"battle for blue skies.\" China will improve its air quality forecasting and early warning systems and enhance coordinated management of harmful airborne particles known as PM2.5, as well as ozone pollution, said Li Tianwei, Director of the Department of Atmospheric Environment. \"The battle for blue skies remains unchanged,\" Li said according to a transcript on the Ministry of Ecology and Environment's website on Monday. Though some progress has been made, air pollution remains a major problem in China and affects economies and people's quality of life, said the World Health Organization (WHO). Air pollution is responsible for about 2 million deaths in China annually, the WHO said. Of those deaths, ambient air pollution caused more than 1 million deaths, while household air pollution from cooking with polluting fuels and technologies caused another million deaths, it said on its website. The WHO considers PM2.5 concentrations above 50 micrograms per cubic metre \"severe\" air pollution. China's air quality improved significantly in 2024, Li said. The average concentration of PM2.5 in cities was 29.3 micrograms per cubic metre, a year-on-year decrease of 2.7%. The proportion of days with good air quality reached 87.2%, up by 1.7 percentage points year-on-year. China must introduce new emission standards that align with global best practises, Li said, adding that the country will boost the share of new energy vehicles and machinery in airports, ports and logistics parks. Authorities also plan to promote the long-distance transportation of bulk goods by rail and water, rather than by roads. President Xi Jinping has said China prioritises environmental protection, promoting green lifestyles and that conservation of nature is an essential part of building a modern socialist country.

The accident took place at 9:49 a.m. (0049 GMT) in Anseong, about 70 km (43.5 miles) from Seoul, when five 50 metre (164 ft) concrete structures supporting the highway bridge collapsed one after another after being hoisted into place by a crane, the Yonhap News Agency reported. Ko Kyung-man, an Anseong fire official, said that four people had died, including two Chinese nationals, and six were injured, including five who were in a critical condition. The five also included one Chinese citizen. \"They were working to install a deck on the bridge,\" Ko told a televised briefing. \"All of the 10 were up on the deck ... and fell from both sides when it collapsed.\" Broadcaster YTN aired dramatic footage showing a deck of a towering bridge collapsing at the site. Rescue workers at the site were seen examining twisted metal struts and fractured concrete slabs below the columns of the highway bridge.

REUTERS/Kim Hong-ji Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Acting President Choi Sang-mok called to mobilise all available personnel and resources to rescue any missing people and to ensure safety measures to prevent further damage, his office said. The National Fire Agency said that it has mobilised three helicopters and nearly 150 officials for the search and rescue operation, and the Transport Ministry said it has dispatched a team of officials to the scene. Deadly accidents continue to regularly occur at industrial sites in South Korea, which introduced a law in 2022 to address safety lapses and punish company management if a worker is killed on the job. Earlier in February, six people died in a fire in a hotel construction site in the port city of Busan, with around 100 people evacuated including 14 workers plucked to safety by a helicopter after they had taken refuge on a rooftop. In June last year, a fire at a lithium battery factory that authorities blamed on quality control failures and inadequate safety training killed 23 workers. Data released in March by South Korea's labour ministry showed that 598 industrial workers died in 2023, with the construction sector accounting for nearly half, or 303, though the total death toll was down from 644 in 2022.

SONG KYUNG-SEOK/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Summary Parliamentary lawyers accuse Yoon of planning to be dictator Yoon defends martial law as a warning, not full military rule Parliament rebukes Yoon's judgment on national emergencies Constitutional Court ruling on Yoon's fate due in days SEOUL, Feb 25 (Reuters) - South Korean parliamentary lawyers seeking President Yoon Suk Yeol's removal over his short-lived imposition of martial law compared him to a dictator on Tuesday during their final arguments at his impeachment trial. In his own closing statement to the eight justices on the Constitutional Court reviewing his impeachment, Yoon defended his decisions as lawful and necessary to protect the country. Yoon faces being removed from office less than three years into his five-year presidency if the court upholds parliament's impeachment, which accused him of declaring martial law on December 3 with no justifiable constitutional grounds. Lee Kwang-beom, one of the lawyers for parliament, compared Yoon to previous autocratic South Korean leaders including Park Chung-hee and Chun Doo-hwan. Yoon wanted to create a world where his every word would be written into the constitution, and sought to privatise the country and reign over the constitution, Lee argued. \"We call this dictatorship,\" he said. \"The moment he declared martial law, he effectively gave up on his position as the president of our democratic republic.\" Another lawyer said Yoon's allegations of election fraud were conspiracy theories that have had a \"fatal\" impact on the credibility of the election system. In his final remarks, Yoon rejected any comparison of his actions to previous declarations of martial law, saying his decision was intended as an appeal to the people to overcome \"anti-state forces\", pro-North Korea sympathizers, and opposition gridlock. 'NATIONAL CRISIS' \"The purpose of martial law was to inform the public of the national crisis we're in,\" he said in a statement. Yoon said he never meant to impose full martial rule, instead arguing he intended to warn of the opposition Democratic Party's abuse of its parliamentary majority. He also denied having acted out of personal interest, saying it would have been easier to just wait out the rest of his term. The justices are expected to take days to rule on whether to remove him from office or reinstate him. Yoon has said martial law, which lasted just six hours before he rescinded the decree, was not a failure but simply ended sooner than he intended. He said there was no point in debating accusations that he ordered military commanders to break into parliament to remove lawmakers gathering to lift the martial law decree because \"nothing actually happened\" and nobody was harmed. Yoon's arguments drew a rebuke from parliament that the president was incapable of judging what constituted a national emergency that requires such an extreme act and that he might attempt to impose martial law again if reinstated. His shocking martial law announcement, which banned political and parliamentary activity, triggered a constitutional crisis that also led to the impeachment of the prime minister who became acting president. The finance minister currently leads the country. Yoon is being held in the Seoul Detention Centre after he was arrested over a separate criminal case that charged him with leading an insurrection. Yoon, a former prosecutor, is the first sitting president to face a criminal trial. The Constitutional Court has not said when it will deliver its ruling on Yoon but has up to six months from December 14, when it registered the case. Former President Park Geun-hye was removed from office in 2017 by the Constitutional Court 11 days after the final arguments in her impeachment trial. If Yoon is removed, a new presidential election must be held within 60 days. Sign up here.

The pricey broadcast rights for the Indian Premier League (IPL) and other cricketing events which cost Disney and Reliance nearly $10 billion in recent years, are set to weigh big on the merged group , which is India's biggest entertainment giant. Battling competitors Netflix and Amazon in the $28-billion market, the Reliance-owned venture is holding a month of closed-door seminars in seven Indian cities to woo small companies to become IPL advertisers, offering ad packages worth $17,000. \"Ads are integral to IPL coverage,\" the company said in one document that set its streaming service a target of reaching 40 million smart TVs and 420 million mobile devices during the IPL, set to run for 60 days from March 22. The document shows Reliance is privately pitching advertising agencies with \"brain mapping\" research that it says analysed the brain cells, or neurons, of participants to show its streaming ads have a higher engagement rate than Google. Five media executives and Reliance sources, and two company pitch decks, revealed its focus on adding small advertisers as it beefs up digital ad inventory to increase streaming revenues, in strategies Reuters is the first to reveal. \"You have to make money,\" said one company executive familiar with the thinking behind the effort. All the sources spoke on condition of anonymity as the strategies are confidential. Reliance's Star India, which runs its broadcast and streaming business, and Disney (DIS.N) , opens new tab did not respond to requests for comment. Reliance also plans to monetise tiny scorecard space on mobile screens, after having decided this month to end free streaming of IPL on its JioHotstar app, offered since 2023, in the first major sign it is battling revenue pressures. IPL launched in 2008, becoming an instant success among the subcontinent's cricket-crazy fans. In November, 10 teams, one of them owned by the Ambanis, fought a fierce $74-million bidding war for cricketers to play the 74 matches of this year's IPL. Digital is the new media battleground in India, where TV channel pricing is strictly regulated and geolocation of ads is not possible on the traditional broadcast medium. Amid fierce rivalry with Google and Meta, which dominate India's digital advertising space, Reliance plans to exploit user data to offer ads targeted on the basis of such aspects as viewers' ages, incomes and locations, while upping ad rates. Many small businesses and company executives attended Reliance's February seminar in the southern tech hub of Bengaluru to be pitched one-on-one with IPL ads described as being more affordable than ever. A Reliance ad rates booklet showed packages started at $17,000, but wellness startup owner Anita Devraj, who attended the seminar, said, \"I find it cheaper to advertise on Instagram and YouTube.\" COSTLY RIGHTS INVESTMENT Before their merger, Reliance (RELI.NS) , opens new tab and Disney spent roughly $3 billion each to bag IPL streaming and TV rights for the period from 2023 to 2027, and billions more on ICC cricket and other leagues. But the heavy investment caused pain, with Disney India later describing the ICC rights as \"onerous\" and causing an estimated loss of $1.42 billion. However, Reliance sees the IPL as key to luring advertisers, given the sport's popularity, and consumers who may stay on to subscribe to other content, such as HBO movies or Bollywood hits, said the first company source. To overcome the Indian antitrust body's concerns with cricket rights and win clearance of the merger, the companies committed not to raise ad rates to an \"unreasonable level\". This year, Reliance has raised IPL streaming ad rates by up to 25%, according to a Reliance executive and documents drafted by one of its Indian media agencies, the Media Ant. Packages at lower rates are offered by media agencies which buy ads in bulk from Reliance to sell to clients. While Media Ant's website offers IPL packages starting at 500,000 rupees ($5,800), YouTube ad packs start at just 10,000 rupees ($115). Streaming is becoming mainstream but competition is stiff, Uday Shankar, the vice-chairperson of the Reliance entity, told McKinsey in an October interview. \"You're competing with global players: Google and Meta,\" he said. \"Most of digital advertising revenue goes to these two.\" Reliance's growing focus on challenging U.S. streaming tech is evidenced by pitch deck pictures of people wearing headsets and heart rate monitors to track neurons for a \"brain-mapping study\" comparing how engaging its IPL ads were against rivals. It said the results showed the \"focus\", \"engagement\" and \"memorability\" of the ads were up to four times greater than Meta's Instagram and Google's YouTube. The two firms did not reply to requests for comment on the Reliance assertions. \"No platform has more engaged viewers than YouTube,\" Google's own \"brain-imaging study\", with participants from Britain and Germany, concluded last year. However, Reliance cannot hope to beat the reach of YouTube, with nearly 500 million active users in India, while touting neurons can only take you so far in the ad market, said Daoud Jackson, a streaming analyst at Informa TechTarget. \"You aren't going to win an argument in a board meeting next year by pointing at a brain scan, you'll win that market by pointing at the profit and loss chart.\" Sign up here.

REUTERS/Angelika Warmuth Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Summary Conservatives win with second worst post-war result Merz doubles down on fears over U.S. policy Far-right AfD surges to win 20.8% of vote Focus on debt brake to tackle economic slump https://www.reuters.com/world/germany/ BERLIN, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Germany's election winner Friedrich Merz warned the United States on Monday against turning its back on allies but also urged Europeans to build up their own defence capabilities, saying it was now \"five minutes to midnight for Europe\". His comments underscored the turmoil engulfing the transatlantic alliance since the re-election of U.S. President Donald Trump and fears he could strike a deal with Russia over Ukraine while Kyiv and Europe just watch from the sidelines. Merz's conservatives are looking to quickly form a government after winning a national election on Sunday but face tricky coalition talks and the prospect of an obstructive parliament after far-right and far-left parties surged. Time is pressing for Europe's ailing largest economy. German businesses are demanding help to remain globally competitive, society is split over migration and the new government must also deal with a confrontational Trump administration threatening tariffs as well as a hostile Russia and an assertive China. \"And what we also see with the greatest concern, of course, is the attempt (by Trump) to make a deal with Russia on Ukraine over the heads of the Europeans, over the heads of Ukraine,\" Merz told a press conference. \"It will come as no surprise to you when I say that this is unacceptable both for Ukraine and for Europe,\" Merz said, adding it would be difficult if those who put \"America First\" actually made their motto \"America Alone\". His conservative bloc wants to ally with Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD), who came in third, after the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) surged to a historic second place. But Merz's bid for an alliance with the SPD comes after a bruising campaign that highlighted deep policy divisions, in particular over migration. The SPD, smarting from its worst post-war result, may set a high price for any deal. The AfD and the radical Left Party jointly secured one third of seats in the new parliament, enough to block constitutional changes needed to loosen state borrowing limits - changes that some economists say are crucial to revive the flagging economy. DEBT BRAKE Merz said he was in talks with other parties to reform the debt brake that restricts borrowing, even before the new parliament is officially sworn in. He would also sound out allies about creating another special off-budget fund to raise defence spending. However, a resurgent Left party and the AfD may wield a blocking minority in parliament that could stymie any increase in defence spending needed to shore up European security. The Left said on Monday it wants more borrowing but its support will hinge on the cash not being used for rearmament. Both the AfD and the Left oppose military aid to Ukraine. \"Friedrich Merz must brace himself now,\" said Left co-leader Jan van Aken. Hitherto known as an Atlanticist, Merz again on Monday questioned the reliability of the United States as an ally, adding: \"This really is five minutes to midnight for Europe.\" On Sunday Merz had criticised what he called \"outrageous\" comments from the Trump administration during the election campaign, comparing them to hostile interventions from Moscow. He also warned Washington not to create divisions by offering preferential tariffs to some European Union members. In another bold move on Monday, Merz invited Benjamin Netanyahu to visit Germany in defiance of an arrest warrant for the Israeli prime minister issued by the International Criminal Court over alleged war crimes in Gaza. Merz's conservative CDU/CSU bloc took first place in Sunday's election with 28.5% - their second worst result of the postwar era - while the AfD won 20.8%, its best ever result, according to provisional results. However, mainstream parties rule out working with the AfD, a party which is monitored by German security services on suspicion of extremism but has been endorsed by U.S. figures including billionaire Elon Musk. TOUGH TALKS AHEAD Merz, who has no previous experience in office, aims to have a government by Easter, though the SPD warned its support was not a given. In the election campaign, Merz promised a radical crackdown on immigration, saying he would not compromise on the issue. He drew sharp SPD criticism for pushing a parliamentary resolution on migration last month with support from the AfD. The move was seen by critics as an unforgivable breach of a political quarantine to keep the AfD out of power. SPD politicians said they could no longer trust Merz as a result. Analysts say the pressure is on for the next coalition to come together quickly to hold its own against the Trump administration, and to fend off the AfD by showing that mainstream parties can address voters' concerns. If it does not, then the 12-year-old AfD, which is set to be the largest opposition party in the Bundestag, could be a frontrunner for the next elections set for 2029. Musk reaffirmed his support for the party on Monday, predicting on X that the AfD \"will be the majority party by the next election\". Sign up here.

Unsettled by its increasingly tough stance on migration, however, he cast his vote on Sunday for the far-left Left Party. The successor to East Germany's Communist Party on Sunday scored 8.8% in Germany's federal election, its best result in years, despite a split led by former leader Sahra Wagenknecht, who launched her own BSW party last year. Its resurgence, as well as a historic result for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) at 20.8%, demonstrates growing support for the extremes as the outlook for Europe's largest economy darkens and the arrival of millions of migrants polarises society. This in turn is complicating building a government and even governance in a country once considered a bastion of stability. The AfD and Left Party together now have the potential to block changes to Germany's constitution, including reforms to debt rules many economists deem essential. \"We are witnessing a strengthening of the political fringes. At the same time, the decline of the major parties continues,\" said Benjamin Hoehne, a political science professor at the Technical University Chemnitz. Up until reunification in 1990, both of Germany's main centrist parties, the conservatives and the SPD, tended to achieve around 40% of the vote each, making it easy for them to form majority government coalitions either together or with the pro-market Free Democrats (FDP). The arrival of the Left Party and the growth of the Greens started nibbling at support for the SPD. The emergence of the 12-year-old AfD has in turn weakened the conservatives, while the populist BSW has further fragmented the vote. In total, the CDU and SPD achieved just 44.9% of the vote on Sunday compared to 49.8% in the last election and 81.3% in 1987. Including the Greens and FDP, the share of the four mainstream parties has dropped to 60.8% from 98.7% in 1987. All the more radical parties - the anti-NATO and Russia-friendly Left Party, BSW and AfD - are doing better in former Communist eastern Germany where political allegiances are more fickle and incomes and trust in democratic institutions are lower. Savvy at social media and tapping into worries about the future, they are also doing better among young voters. \"A lot of people see themselves going into a fierce political battle and they feel that they must act now,\" said Alkadamani, 20, who lives in the east German city of Leipzig. The Left Party, which promised rent caps, tax-free food, and more support for low-income households funded by the wealthy, was the most popular among Germans under 30 , particularly women, scoring 24% of the votes, with the AfD closely behind at 21%. \"In the past, the Left was very much a clientele party. Now it has also become a party of the younger generation,\" Hermann Binkert, head of the German Institute for New Social Answers (INSA).

REUTERS/Lisi Niesner Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab GROWING POLARISATION OF POLITICAL LANDSCAPE Until December, The Left Party was at 3% in the polls, casting doubt on whether it would make the 5% threshold to make it into parliament. A fiery speech , however, by its leader condemning the conservatives for using far-right backing to push through an anti-migration motion went viral on TikTok, pushing its membership figures to a record. The rising importance of social media, whose algorithms reward provocative statements, is contributing to the rise of fringe parties, say analysts. \"The Left Party was mostly excluded from the big TV debates – another sign that the influence of the old media is waning – and the elections are won and lost on social media,\" the Eurointelligence think tank wrote in a research note. The Greens and SPD also criticised the conservatives' possible cooperation with the far-right but less forcefully. According to an Infratest poll published by the Tageschau broadcaster, the Left has attracted 550,000 and 540,000 votes from the SPD and Greens respectively. Sarah-Lee Heinrich, 23, a former spokesperson for the Green Youth, said she was disappointed with the party's shift rightwards. In this election, she ran as a candidate for the Left. POLARISATION COMPLICATING GOVERNABILITY The weakness of mainstream parties in Sunday's election as well as their refusal to work with the AfD has left only one viable coalition scenario: a so-called grand coalition of the two former big-tent parties, the SPD and conservatives. If those negotiations fail, Germany could be facing a minority government or even new elections. Left Party leaders expressed surprise on Monday to have ended up in such a position of power, making clear they would condition any support for a relaxing of borrowing rules, possibly on increased social spending. Alkadamani travelled to Berlin on Sunday to join celebrations in the working-class, migrant-heavy neighbourhood of Neukoeln, where the party more than doubled its 2021 vote share, securing 29.9% and finishing in first place. \"I am still an SPD member,\" he said. \"But this was a protest vote.\" Sign up here.

REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Companies Key Energy Services Inc Follow LITTLETON, Colorado, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Following rare back-to-back economic contractions in 2023 and 2024, German businesses are hopeful that a new government formed by the conservative CDU/CSU party and the center-left Social Democrats can revive Europe's largest economy in 2025. High energy costs, weak consumer demand, stiff competition from China and a lack of supportive policy reform have all been blamed for the economic woes facing Germany in recent years, and remain major challenges for the incoming government. Sunday's election results indicate that CDU/CSU may be able to form a government with just one other party and avert a repeat of the previous government's three-way coalition that struggled to decisively alter Germany's policy landscape. And incoming Chancellor Friedrich Merz has indicated that coalition talks will begin immediately, with industrial growth and job creation among his main priorities. Below are key data points on Germany's power prices, energy mix, industrial production and foreign trade that can be tracked to gauge the impact of any policy changes under the new government. POWER PRICES German industry has cited high energy costs as a major factor impeding growth in recent years, rendering German products uncompetitive on the world stage. After averaging around 40 euros ($41.84) per megawatt hour (MWh) through 2020, German wholesale power prices jumped to an average of 235 euros/MWh in 2022 as the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war snarled natural gas flows to Europe. Germany wholesale base power prices That surge in power costs hammered all major energy consumers in Germany in 2022 and for most of the following year, and resulted in a major contraction in gas use by industry. Wholesale power prices retreated to an average of around 80 euros/MWh in 2024, but have climbed back above 120 euros/MWh so far in 2025 due to rising regional natural gas prices, which help set regional power costs. Going forward, power prices will remain a critical gauge of industrial health. German power firms already plan to add more renewable energy generation capacity in 2025, but new policy measures that accelerate clean energy additions could help to boost overall power supplies and potentially cap wholesale prices. Continued high reliance on natural gas for power production, however, means that Germany's influence over power prices will likely remain beyond the reach of policymakers and power producers. GAS FIX The share of natural gas within Germany's power generation mix is another factor determining the outlook for the country. Germany relies on imports for over 95% of its gas supplies, according to the Energy Institute, and used gas to generate around 17% of its electricity in 2024, according to Ember. Germany's electricity generation by source 2000-2024 That gas generation share was the highest since 2020, and indicates that Germany's power system has actually become increasingly gas-reliant despite the cuts to pipeline supplies from Russia since 2022. To replace the reduced Russian supplies, Germany has boosted gas imports from the United States and other suppliers in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG), which can cost multiple times more than gas supplied via pipeline. If German power producers and industry continue to rely on gas for a substantial share of generation, government policies that help lower the cost of imported gas could help spur greater power consumption and output by industry. But given restrictions on government debt in Germany, the incoming government may struggle to pass measures to reduce the gas cost burden for power firms without facing opposition from parliament members who are against debt increases. OUTPUT AND TRADE Due to a mix of high power costs as well as weak demand for German-made industrial goods, German production of a slew of energy-intensive products including steel, fertilizers and chemicals has slumped in recent years. German output of cars has also been hit by weak local consumer demand as well as record exports of cars from China that have served to undermine demand for Germany's vehicles. Germany’s output of key industrial ingredients The incoming German chancellor campaigned on expanding the country's industrial base, and has vowed to protect and grow jobs in the sector. But policies aimed at spurring demand for German industrial goods require changes to taxes and spending levels, which again may encounter parliamentary opposition from rival parties. Policymakers may also aim to boost Germany's exports, which have flagged since 2022 amid weak global consumer demand and stiff competition from other exporting nations. Germany’s export revenues have struggled to grow since 2022 But given the impending tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, as well as ongoing trade disputes between Europe and China, the incoming German government may have only limited scope to influence export flows over the near to medium term.

The deal marks a wider presence by Tesla in Germany, where it runs a manufacturing site near Berlin, even after CEO Elon Musk endorsed the far-right party AfD, which mainstream parties have refused to work with due to its extreme positions. Tesla sold almost 60% fewer cars in Germany in January than a year earlier, as the U.S. electric vehicle maker faces a test of popularity amid Musk's U.S. political involvement . Manz's insolvency administrator and Tesla Automation GmbH, a subsidiary of the U.S. company, signed a purchase agreement on Monday, the German company said. The parties agreed not to disclose a purchase price, and completion of the transaction is subject to merger control law. Tesla Automation, which specializes in the construction of special-purpose machines at three German locations, plans to take over more than 300 employees, acquire movable tangible assets, and use Manz's property in Reutlingen. Approximately 100 employees will lose their jobs and not be transferred to Tesla Automation, according to Manz. Insolvency administrator Martin Mucha said the structured sales process for other assets was moving forward. \"We are currently holding promising talks with several interested parties,\" added Mucha in a statement.

REUTERS/Massimo Pinca/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Summary Companies Stellantis operates 14 brands, more than major rivals Chairman Elkann steering while search for new CEO goes on Slumping sales, margins led to ouster of CEO Tavares Company will report full-year results on Wednesday MILAN, Feb 24 (Reuters) - As Stellantis (STLAM.MI) , opens new tab chairman John Elkann interviews CEO candidates, deciding how many of the automaker's 14 brands have a viable future is a significant priority. The French-Italian company's sprawling portfolio - the largest among its peers, which mostly focus on one or two brands - reflects its origins in a 2021 merger of Fiat-Chrysler and Peugeot owner PSA. Shrinking it could reduce complexity and allow some marketing, development and sales functions to be merged. But each brand - from bestsellers like Jeep, Ram and Peugeot to struggling DS, Lancia and Alfa Romeo - has its fans, making which to drop a difficult choice. In Europe, for example, where Stellantis is the second-largest carmaker after Volkswagen, its top-selling Peugeot marque had a market share of just 4.9% last year, or eighth position overall. Low consumer recognition of the Stellantis corporate name, unlike rivals such as VW or Toyota, is another handicap. A source familiar with Elkann's thinking told Reuters the topic was a priority, and that any applicant for chief executive without an idea about the brands \"is not the right candidate\". Former CEO Carlos Tavares often said traditional automakers faced a \"Darwinian era\" where the weakest would fail - while insisting all Stellantis' brands had a future. When Tavares was forced out in December, Elkann moved fast to rebuild investor confidence hurt by slumping sales and profit margins in the U.S. market, traditionally its most profitable, with the Jeep, Ram, Chrysler and Dodge brands. The world's fourth-largest carmaker globally by sales has performed less well in Europe, while it closed a Jeep-making joint-venture in China almost three years ago and has no plans to push for a relaunch as opportunities there recede. The new CEO must \"be ready to take strong decisions\", said Fabio Caldato of Acomea SGR, which owns Stellantis shares. \"If I am not thinking with my heart, but as an investor, I would see it as very positive that the new CEO is determined to review the brand portfolio,\" he said. Brands seen by analysts as vulnerable to a portfolio reshuffle include premium marques Alfa Romeo, DS and Lancia. Dodge and Chrysler are seen as survivors despite a less than stellar performance, as they have U.S. driver recognition and appeal to specific market segments. Automakers have traditionally dropped famous brands only reluctantly, as when GM axed Saturn and Pontiac and Ford its Mercury nameplate during the late 2000s recession. In a statement to Reuters, Stellantis said each of its brands had plans for new products and that recent organizational changes were aimed at supporting them. \"Stellantis is focused on providing even more choices to its customers, leveraging on the deep history and strong identities of its 14 brands,\" it said. Stellantis' global sales by brand \"MAGIC WAND\" A Stellantis source said the portfolio's problems are known internally, but that individual brands' popularity in particular countries or segments meant it was not obvious which to cut. Jeep and Ram are Stellantis' U.S. best sellers, while Chrysler - now largely confined to the Pacifica minivan - and Dodge sold less than 150,000 units apiece in the country last year. Dodge's product lineup has dwindled to one muscle car, the Charger, along with a sporty crossover and one SUV. Jeep accounted for at least 15% of Stellantis' global sales in 2024, according to Reuters calculations, and Chrysler and Dodge around 3% each. \"If I were to have a magic wand ... I'd probably say Jeep should absorb Chrysler and Ram should absorb Dodge,\" said Erin Keating of research firm Cox Automotive. \"But you're not saving a ton of money,\" she added, as the four \"each have their own brand equity\", complement each other in terms of range and share the same dealers. Stellantis was fifth in the U.S. market by sales last year, with an overall share of 8.1%, losing the No. 4 spot to Honda after price rises cost it clients, leading to the shock profit warning that precipitated Tavares' exit. Jeep ranked 11th as a single brand, with a market share just below 4%. Keating said the company's focus now should be getting pricing back into line with what customers are willing to pay, a view also expressed by U.S. dealers. \"Let's figure out a way to build those iconic brands back,\" said David Kelleher, who has a Chrysler-Dodge-Jeep-Ram store outside Philadelphia. Sales of Stellantis brands in the U.S. EUROPEAN CHALLENGE Europe, where Stellantis - slow to electrify - faces stringent carbon emissions rules and more Chinese competition, could be a bigger challenge. \"It would be a problem if Stellantis closed brands,\" said dealership owner Tony Fassina, who sells Fiats and Alfa Romeos in Milan. \"It would mean losing sales for sure.\" Marco Santino at consultancy Oliver Wyman said Stellantis marques such as Peugeot and Opel overlap in Europe's mass-market segment, while it is struggling in the premium market. Europe-focused Alfa Romeo, Lancia and DS each took only a 0.3% market share in the region in 2024, far behind rivals including Audi and BMW. In comparison, Peugeot made up a fifth of the company's global sales. Alfa could become a niche sport brand as the fanbase for its cars ages, Santino suggested. Any broad repositioning to revive the premium marque \"you need to do ... from scratch\". Stellantis aims to launch about 20 new or updated models between late 2024 and 2025, mostly EVs and hybrids including the Citroen C3, expected to be the most affordable European-made EV. Its JV with Leapmotor, sometimes described as Stellantis' 15th brand, under which it can sell, import and manufacture Leapmotor's EV models outside China, could be a further boost to electrification. The market share of Stellantis brands in Europe Fiat, Stellantis' global bestseller, is popular in emerging markets such as Brazil or Turkey, and in the European city car segment with the 500 model. It could be focused on affordable models, Santino said, while another brand could shift to focus on EVs. \"Markets are changing fast and less predictably than we thought,\" Santino said. \"Maybe not yet, but within a few years, the time will be ripe for Stellantis to close some brands.\" Sign up here.

REUTERS/Chris Helgren/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Summary Companies Iraq and BP sign deal to redevelop Kirkuk oilfields Agreement includes drilling and infrastructure projects BP's remuneration linked to production increase DUBAI, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Iraq and oil major BP (BP.L) , opens new tab have signed a deal to redevelop four Kirkuk oil and gas fields, BP said on Tuesday, a breakthrough for Iraq, where output has been constrained by years of war, corruption and sectarian tensions. The signing comes a day before BP plans to update investors on its strategy and is widely expected to reduce investments in renewable energy and shift back to invest more in oil and gas. BP is expected to spend up to $25 billion over the lifetime of the project, a senior Iraqi oil official told Reuters in early February. Under the terms of the agreement, which is subject to final ratification by Iraq's government, BP will work with North Oil Co.(NOC), North Gas Co. (NGC) and the new operator to stabilize and grow production, BP said. Work will include a drilling programme, the rehabilitation of existing wells and facilities, and the construction of new infrastructure, including gas expansion projects, it added. BP said its remuneration will be linked to incremental production volumes, price and costs and will be able to book a share of production and reserves proportionate to the fees it earns for helping to increase production. BP would boost crude production capacity from the four oilfields in Kirkuk by 150,000 barrels per day (bpd) to raise total capacity to at least 450,000 bpd in 2-3 years, according to a senior Iraqi oil official. Tuesday's signing came after the two parties agreed on \"technical issues and contractual terms, including the economic model of the project,\" according to a statement from the Iraqi prime minister office. The BP deal is focused on rehabilitating facilities in four oilfields and developing natural gas to support Iraq's domestic energy needs. BP was a member of the consortium of oil companies that discovered oil in Kirkuk in the 1920s. BP has estimated that the Kirkuk field holds about 9 billion barrels of recoverable oil.

REUTERS/May James/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Summary Companies Trinidad to ask Trump administration for an extension to develop Dragon gas project Shell planning to green-light offshore project this year Shell, NGC began project engineering work on the field HOUSTON/PORT OF SPAIN, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Trinidad and Tobago plans to ask U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to extend a license for Shell (SHEL.L) , opens new tab and Trinidad's National Gas Company (NGCTT.UL) to develop a key gas project in Venezuela, four sources close to the preparations said. The U.S. license was first granted in early 2023 as an exemption to Washington's sanctions on Venezuela. It enabled NGC and Shell to move forward on planning and preparation for the Dragon natural gas project off Venezuela's coast, aimed at supplying gas to Trinidad from around 2027. Washington amended the license in 2023 to allow payments in hard currency or in kind to Venezuela and its state company PDVSA (PDVSA.UL) for gas supplies, and extended the expiration date to October 2025. Shell and NGC will need an extension to begin production once they make a final investment decision on the project, which is expected this year, the sources added. According to planning by the two companies, Dragon's initial production flow should be around 200 million cubic feet per day, one of the sources said. U.S. sanctions target the entire Venezuelan oil and gas industry, which is controlled by PDVSA, meaning countries like Trinidad and private operators that abide by the measures require U.S. licenses to export or pay revenue to sanctioned entities including the government, the Central Bank and PDVSA. Trinidad's Prime Minister Keith Rowley this month said his government would soon brief Washington on the importance of keeping U.S. licenses to develop gas projects with Venezuela for reasons of regional energy security. He did not elaborate on the planned talks. Shell and NGC have had access to seismic, geotechnical and well data on the Dragon field, and are satisfied that there is at least the 4.2 trillion cubic feet of gas in place that PDVSA said existed, two of the sources told Reuters. Shell also completed a seabed survey to ensure it would not encounter any hazards and is now trying to determine where and how many wells will be drilled, the pipeline route to its facilities in Trinidad and the subsea tieback, they added. Both companies have been working closely with Trinidad's Energy Minister Stuart Young and Venezuela's Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, who have separately visited the survey vessel. NGC deferred questions about the license extension to Trinidad's government. Shell declined to comment. PDVSA, Trinidad's energy ministry and the U.S. Treasury Department did not immediately reply to requests for comment. IN PROGRESS The Dragon field lies in Venezuelan waters near the maritime border with Trinidad. Trinidad needs the fuel to boost its liquefied natural gas and petrochemical industries, and Venezuela hopes to access cash flow from gas exports. Despite over a dozen licenses and authorizations granted in recent years, Washington has limited Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's revenue sources after rejecting his claim to have won two reelections. U.S. sanctions on the energy sector were first imposed in 2019. Maduro and his allies have assailed U.S. sanctions as illegitimate measures that amount to an \"economic war\" designed to cripple Venezuela, and blamed them for some economic hardships and shortages. They have also cheered what they say is the country's resilience despite the measures. If supply contract negotiations between Trinidad, Venezuela and Shell lead to prices close to the most recent gas contracts signed in Venezuela, Dragon's volumes would generate some $30 million in monthly revenue from sales, of which 20% would go to Venezuela's coffers as royalty payments, according to calculations by consultancy Gas Energy Latin America. \"Those numbers would hardly represent a problem for the United States,\" one of the sources said, referring to potential controversies over revenue to Venezuela. Trinidad's energy minister Young last year said Dragon's potential output is much larger than its initial flow. If produced, Dragon along with another Shell project called Manatee, which is on the Trinidad side of the border, could supply a combined 1 billion cubic feet of gas per day to Trinidad and its flagship Atlantic LNG project, Young added.

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Companies UnitedHealth Group Inc Follow Feb 25 (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley requested detailed information on UnitedHealth's (UNH.N) , opens new tab Medicare billing practices, in a letter to CEO Andrew Witty on Monday, amid reports suggesting the insurer may have leveraged billing rules to its advantage. Shares of the company fell 1.7% to $453.90 in afternoon trading after the Wall Street Journal first reported the news. Over the last several months, The WSJ has run a series of stories detailing how UnitedHealth profited from using Medicare billing rules to its favor. Grassley, who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, demanded the health insurer provide all records relating to the company's compliance program, training manuals and guidance documents to better understand its billing practices. The letter cited findings from the Journal's articles and said \"the apparent fraud, waste, and abuse at issue is simply unacceptable and harms not only Medicare beneficiaries, but also the American taxpayer\". We welcome the opportunity to share the facts with Senator Grassley, especially given the ongoing misinformation campaign by the WSJ, UnitedHealth said in a statement. On Friday, WSJ reported the U.S. Justice Department is investigating UnitedHealth's Medicare billing practices, while the health insurer said it was unaware of any new probe underway. The company is expected to provide details before March 10 on its steps to review all diagnoses submitted to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for Medicare Advantage enrollees, as well as identify if they are obscure, irrelevant or inaccurate, according to the letter. Nearly half of the 65 million people covered by Medicare, the U.S. program for people aged 65 and older or with disabilities, are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans run by private insurers. Insurers are paid a set rate for each patient, but can be paid more for patients with multiple health conditions. UnitedHealth, with various businesses including a large pharmacy benefit manager, faces margin pressure from rising medical costs in its insurance business. Sign up here.

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File Photo [1/6] A man uses a vape as he walks on Broadway in New York City, U.S., September 9, 2019. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Summary Companies Some vape firms in U.S., China have altered their business model, changed their structure after authorities cracked down FDA struggles to contain sales of unauthorised vapes despite sales bans Big tobacco firms claim illicit vapes impact their U.S. market share LONDON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Some e-cigarette companies targeted by U.S. authorities have altered their business model or changed their corporate structure, including by transferring operations to offshore firms, according to a U.S. regulator and representatives of two companies. Such tactics have complicated U.S. efforts to stem the flow of vapes lacking authorisation into the country, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). \"The FDA is aware of, and closely monitoring, instances in which companies attempt to change the labeling of illegally marketed products, or the structure of their business, to avoid detection,\" it said in a statement to Reuters. The regulator did not comment on specific brands or companies. Chinese vape giant Heaven Gifts transferred the ongoing U.S. operations of its brand Lost Mary, whose products are not authorised in the United States, to a British Virgin Islands (BVI) firm - Wonder Ladies Limited - after the FDA banned several companies spanning China, the U.S. and South Korea from importing its flagship label Elfbar in 2023, the company told Reuters. Lost Mary remains widely available in the United States. A Texas-based e-cigarette firm, Ludicrous Distro, a trading name for American Vape Company, stopped selling its own unlicensed vapes under the brand name Esco Bars , and shifted instead to distributing a wider variety of unauthorised devices from third parties, its website shows. Heaven Gifts spokesperson Jacques Li said the Chinese company had exited the U.S. market by transferring its U.S. Lost Mary operations to Wonder Ladies after the FDA ban on Elfbar and that it was \"not sidestepping FDA regulations.\" Asked why it was selling unauthorised devices via its website, Ludicrous Distro declined to give the reason for its change of approach but told Reuters it had consistently sought to comply with evolving FDA policies that had created confusion. The agency, which regulates tobacco and alternative products, has denied licenses to some 26 million new nicotine devices since October 2020, FDA data show, especially to fruit and candy flavoured vapes it says appeal to teenagers . A bar chart showing the most commonly used brands among youth vapers in the US in 2024, where Elf Bar is the most widely used brand Some unauthorised products, including Elfbar , Lost Mary, and Esco Bars , which are legal in other countries, have nonetheless been sold widely across the United States, the world's biggest market for smoking alternatives. Shenzhen-based Heaven Gifts, founded by vape tycoon Zhang Shengwei, controlled over 9% of the U.S. e-cigarette market in the year to September 2023 , Reuters reported in 2023, driven by Elfbar. Lost Mary was the seventh most popular disposable vape device in 2024, data from market research firm Circana provided by an industry source and reviewed by Reuters show. Circana said it was unable to confirm or comment on non-public data. A bar chart showing the estimated 2024 retail sales of the top ten disposable vape devices in the United States, where the Geek Bar Pulse is by far the most popular with $582.8 million in sales Li declined to clarify the terms or timing of the transfer of operations to the BVI company. Heaven Gifts still owns the U.S. trademark of Lost Mary via its Hong Kong unit, Imiracle (HK) Limited, according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's (USPTO) register as of February 2025. But Wonder Ladies' name and BVI address now appear on Lost Mary packaging in the United States, a device purchased by Reuters in December showed. A Reuters review of company registries found an Imiracle (HK) Limited director, Tu Xiaoliang, was the authorised representative in Hong Kong for Wonder Ladies and three other BVI firms, which all share an office building there. Tu is one of three Imiracle (HK) Limited directors, alongside founder Zhang, the filings showed. Wonder Ladies and the other three BVI firms either own the U.S. trademark or appear on the packaging for unauthorised vape brands Lost Mary, off-Stamp, RabBeats, Funky Lands and Quasar. Tu did not respond to detailed Reuters questions mailed to her business addresses. All four BVI firms did not reply to letters seeking comment delivered to their Hong Kong office address. Li said he was unaware of Tu's links to the BVI firms and couldn't explain them. He declined to outline Tu's role at Heaven Gifts, citing privacy considerations. Richard Marianos, a former assistant director at the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said the BVI firms could serve to distance vaping brands from their makers and protect associated revenue from enforcement. A former employee with direct knowledge of the issue also told Reuters that Heaven Gifts set up the BVI firms to distance itself from ongoing illegal U.S. sales of Lost Mary and the other unauthorised labels identified by Reuters. The person, who was working for the Chinese vaping company when this strategy was implemented, asked not to be named for fear of legal reprisals. The source provided no documentary evidence. Reuters was unable to independently confirm the person's account. Reuters could not determine who owns Wonder Ladies, whether the BVI firm earns income from U.S. Lost Mary sales or whether revenues flow from the BVI firm to Heaven Gifts. CONFUSION? Ludicrous Distro in recent years relied on Chinese manufacturers to produce Esco Bars, for which it owns the trademark, USPTO data shows. But it stopped distributing Esco Bars, the sixth most popular flavoured disposable vape in the U.S. in the year to June 2022, after the FDA put it on its red list of banned imports in May 2023, Ludicrous Distro's lawyer told Reuters, adding Ludicrous Distro now solely acts as a distributor for third party e-cigarettes and a range of other products. This transition \"was made in a transparent and lawful manner\" and Ludicrous Distro had been \"forthcoming with FDA inspectors about its business operations\", the lawyer also said. A review of Ludicrous Distro's U.S. website showed the company was offering dozens of unauthorised devices, including seven labels flagged as illegal in FDA warning letters to retailers and in press releases, such as Geek Bar and Raz. Ludicrous Distro said many unauthorised products, including from major tobacco companies, remained on the market unchallenged by the FDA, creating significant confusion around what is legal to sell. The FDA's enforcement efforts have faced challenges, including a lack of funding, but any vape launched in recent years without authorisation was \"completely illegal\", said Mitch Zeller, a former director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products. Some FDA staff have been recently dismissed as part of U.S. President Donald Trump's effort to downsize the federal workforce. The FDA has so far authorised just 34 tobacco- and menthol-flavoured vape products, all by big tobacco firms including British American Tobacco (BATS.L) , opens new tab . A bar chart showing the number of FDA new tobacco product applications reach each stage of the application process, where out of more than 26 million that were submitted only 31 ultimately gain authorisation \"RIDING ON GLOBAL AWARENESS\" The American Vapor Manufacturers, an industry association, says the FDA's reluctance to authorise flavoured devices deprives smokers of legal products that can help them quit. Three U.S. smokers told Reuters such devices helped them quit cigarettes. In 2023 and 2024, BAT, which says illegal devices have eaten into its U.S. market share, launched two complaints with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) targeting dozens of vape brand owners, manufacturers and distributors. Among the companies BAT accused of patent infringements and unfair competition were iMiracle (Shenzhen) Technology Co., Ltd, another Heaven Gifts unit, and American Vape Company, the formal name of Ludicrous Distro. BAT filed to withdraw one complaint in January with a view to resubmitting a stronger case later, CEO Tadeu Marroco said on February 13. The ongoing complaint named Wonder Ladies and the three other BVI Firms - Palma Terra Limited, Sailing South Limited and Marea Morada Limited - noting they appear on unauthorised vape packaging. The four BVI firms all list Tu as their representative in Hong Kong and are listed at the same letter-box BVI address, Hong Kong company filings show. BAT and its legal team declined to comment on the ITC cases. Li said he had no knowledge of the BVI companies aside from Wonder Ladies, and Heaven Gifts was not associated with the vape brands aside from Lost Mary. The phrase \"powered by Lost Mary\" appears on the packaging of one of the other brands associated with the BVI firms. The label was likely infringing on the Lost Mary name to \"ride on the brand's global awareness\", Li said. ($1 = 0.8003 pounds) Sign up here.

REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Summary Companies Unilever seeks buyers for Vegetarian Butcher Consumer tastes shift away from plant-based meat Unilever may struggle to get attractive price - bankers say Business may appeal to trade buyers - banker says LONDON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Unilever (ULVR.L) , opens new tab may struggle to attract buyers for its plant-based meat business, complicating the company's plan to cut its exposure to products which are falling out of favour with consumers, industry experts said. Unilever had hoped to emulate the success of industry leaders Beyond Meat (BYND.O) , opens new tab and Impossible Foods, which had dominated the $17 billion meat alternatives market after being founded in 2009 and 2011 respectively. Brands like Unilever's Vegetarian Butcher and Nestle's Garden Gourmet sought to replicate the taste and texture of real meat using plant-based ingredients like beans. They appealed to consumers seeking a healthier alternative to meat and more environmentally friendly products. But a broader trend among consumers to switch to fresh rather than processed produce has hit their popularity over the past two years. U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been critical of plant-based meat products, describing them as \"ultra-processed\". The shift in consumer taste has prompted Unilever to plan a sale of The Vegetarian Butcher, a brand it bought in 2018, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal. But it may struggle to fetch an attractive price, according to two other financial advisers to the food industry. The brand generates only around 50 million euros in annual sales and is loss-making, one consumer sector banker said. The business may appeal to trade buyers including meat producers looking to diversify into plant-based alternatives, another banker said. Unilever declined to comment on the future of the business or on any sale process including a likely valuation. The company on Tuesday ousted CEO Hein Schumacher and replaced him with finance chief Fernando Fernandez in a surprise move, putting a spotlight on the future of Unilever's turnaround plans. Both Unilever and Nestle are planning to slim down and focus on fewer and more profitable brands. \"Nestle and Unilever were expecting these brands to quickly become multi-billion-dollar businesses, and that has not been the case,\" said Laurent Vermer, a partner at Next Food Capital, a Kharis Capital fund, referring to the plant-based meat brands. Unilever had previously backed The Vegetarian Butcher brand, opening a \"Vegan Butchery\" deli shop in Rotterdam in 2023, and striking deals with Burger King and Subway. Rival Nestle is also in a similar bind. Its new Chief Executive Officer Laurent Freixe said last November that the company had placed an excessive focus on plant-based meat only to find the market was not as big as it initially thought. A Nestle spokesperson said the company reduced its plant-based Sweet Earth offerings and now only sells bowls such as General Tso's tofu and bulgogi. Sweet Earth previously sold plant-based chicken strips and bacon. VALUATIONS DECLINE Total sales in the key U.S. market for meat and seafood substitutes declined to $1.6 billion in 2023 from $1.7 billion in the previous year, according to data firm Euromonitor International. Euromonitor projects sales will erode further between now and 2026. \"The perception that these products are 'ultra-processed' and may not be as healthy or nutritious as they appear has been a contributing factor (to the market's decline),\" said Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy. At the height of their popularity, stock market average valuation multiples for plant-based food brands had reached between five and ten times their annual revenues. They have since dropped to an average of one to three times, said John Spayne, founding partner and chair of Spayne Lindsay & Co, a consumer-focused financial advisory firm. Beyond Meat's enterprise value, which takes into account the company's debt, is currently about four times its annual sales, according to LSEG data. Privately-owned Impossible Foods had considered raising new funds, potentially through a public offering, its CEO said last year. But it would now face a tougher market environment, industry experts say. \"The days of high valuation multiples are long gone, though the underlying consumer trend towards alternative meat and dairy proteins continues,\" Spayne said. Plant-based meat makers have struggled with their pricing relative to animal protein products. Beyond Meat trimmed the top end of its annual revenue forecast in November, as cost-conscious consumers switched to cheaper alternatives. Some investors say that meat alternatives will not reach their full potential until the price of animal meat goes up. \"(Animal) meat is way too cheap,\" said Arild Skedsmo, a senior portfolio manager at Norway's biggest pension fund KLP. \"The cost of production is not reflected in the price of the end product,\" he added. \"That's the real issue.\" ($1 = 0.9459 euros) Sign up here.

The board's surprise move to replace Schumacher with finance chief Fernando Fernandez was because of the view that he was the right man to accelerate the group's turnaround strategy, the source said. Schumacher was surprised by the ouster, but the decision involved \"nothing untoward\", the person said. Schumacher did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment via LinkedIn. Peltz, who founded U.S. hedge fund Trian Fund Management, joined the Unilever board in May 2022 after having also served on the board of Procter & Gamble and Mondelez. Unlike some other activist investors, Peltz stresses his intent to work collaboratively with companies but had been pushing Unilever for years to breathe new life into the group. In January 2023, when Schumacher, a Dutch executive, was named CEO of Unilever, Peltz was strongly supportive of the choice. Peltz and Schumacher crossed paths at H.J. Heinz where the investor joined the board in 2006. Peltz's firm put two other directors on the Heinz board. Schumacher's sudden departure after less than two years in the job hit Unilever's shares, which fell as much as 3.4% on Tuesday. They had gained more than 9% since Schumacher took the helm on July 1, 2023. Sign up here. Reporting by Yadarisa Shabong in Bengaluru.

REUTERS/Caitlin Ochs/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab LONDON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - The global debt-to-GDP ratio rose for the first time since 2020 last year, as the world's debt stock hit a new year-end record of $318 trillion and economic growth slowed, an Institute of International Finance report showed on Tuesday. The $7 trillion rise in global debt was less than half of the 2023 increase, when expectations of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts sparked a borrowing surge . The IIF warned, however, that so-called bond vigilantes could punish governments if rising fiscal deficits persist. \"The increasing scrutiny of fiscal balances — particularly in countries with highly polarized political landscapes — has been a defining feature of recent years,\" the IIF said. Market reactions to fiscal policies in the United Kingdom brought down the short-lived tenure of Prime Minister Liz Truss in 2022, while similar pressures in France ousted Prime Minister Michel Barnier last year. Debt-to-GDP - an indicator on the ability to repay debt - approached 328%, a 1.5 percentage point increase, as government debt levels of $95 trillion clashed with slowing inflation and economic growth. The IIF said it expects debt growth to slow this year, amid unprecedented global economic policy uncertainty and still-elevated borrowing costs. Economic policy uncertainty, and elevated borrowing costs, could curtail curtail global debt growth this year, the IIF said It warned, though, that despite high borrowing costs and economic policy uncertainty, its forecast of a $5 trillion increase in government debt this year could rise due to calls for fiscal stimulus and larger military spending in Europe. \"I think we will likely see much more volatility in sovereign debt markets, especially in those countries where we see high political polarization,\" said Emre Tiftik, the IIF's director of sustainability research. ROLLOVER CHALLENGE Emerging markets, driven by China, India, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, accounted for roughly 65% of global debt growth last year. This borrowing, along with a record $8.2 trillion in debt which emerging markets need to roll over this year - 10% of it in foreign currency - could strain countries' abilities to weather looming political and economic storms. Emerging markets face a record $8.2 trillion in bond and loan rollovers in 2025, 10% of it in foreign currencies \"Heightened trade tensions and the Trump administration's decision to freeze U.S. foreign aid, including cuts to USAID, could trigger significant liquidity challenges and curb the ability to roll over and access to FX debt,\" the report said. \"This underscores the increasing importance of domestic revenue mobilization to build resilience against external shocks.\" Tiftik added that the high volatility underscored the need to increase multilateral development banks' abilities to mobilize private capital. Several developing economies, such as Kenya and Romania , have struggled to boost domestic revenue due to public anger over tax hikes and coming elections, respectively. Sign up here.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Summary Companies Bybit hack contributes to crypto market's negative sentiment U.S. tariffs and economic concerns impact investor confidence Bitcoin and ether fall more than 7% Altcoins such as dogecoin, solana, cardano see sharper declines LONDON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Bitcoin dropped below $90,000 to its lowest since November 18 on Tuesday, as market nerves over U.S. tariffs reinforced the blow to crypto investor confidence from last week's $1.5 billion hack of ether from the Bybit exchange. Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market value, was last down 7.25% on the day at $87,169.76. Global investors have been jittery on signs the so-called exceptionalism of the U.S. economy might be fading, while President Donald Trump prepares to impose tariffs. Trump indicated on Monday he still plans to slap a 25% levy on imports from Canada and Mexico from early March and, in a sign of unease, safe-haven U.S. Treasury prices have rallied sharply, sending yields to two-month lows. \"The macroeconomic situation has been the main reason for the price decline in the last few hours,\" said Marcel Heinrichsmeier, crypto assets analyst at DZ Bank. \"The Bybit hack and the memecoin turmoil of the past few weeks have contributed to a generally worse mood in the crypto market than at the beginning of the year.\" While bitcoin has lost nearly 8% in the last week, smaller altcoins have been hit even harder. Memecoin dogecoin and the tokens for the solana and cardano networks have all dropped around 20%, according to CoinGecko. “The brutal sell-off happening in crypto is not unexpected considering we’ve just seen the biggest hack in our history,\" said Charles Wayn, co-founder of Galxe, a decentralized blockchain-based platform. \"This has been compounded by further fears over global tariffs.\" DELAYED REACTION Dubai-headquartered Bybit, the world's second-largest exchange behind Binance, said last week hackers had stolen digital tokens worth around $1.5 billion. Blockchain research firm Elliptic said the hack was \"almost certainly the single largest known theft of any kind in all time.\" Ether , the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, was down 8.46% at $2,414.29, around its lowest since October. Joseph Edwards, head of research at Enigma Securities, said Tuesday's selloff seemed to be \"a bit of a delayed reaction from the Bybit hack.\" \"Markets held up peculiarly well in response to what was expected to be a significant destabilising event ... but there tends to be a price to be paid further down the line... \"We've seen the classic thing, where a slight contraction in risk has caused a small cascading selloff within crypto markets specifically.\" Part of the reason for the shift in sentiment is that policy changes in the U.S. have not lived up to expectations. A few months ago, optimism that the Trump administration would champion a strategic bitcoin fund and loosen regulation left investors primed for another jump in bitcoin, which topped $100,000 in December. But beyond a flurry of appointments of crypto-friendly officials when he took office, there has been little concrete news for investors. In addition, investors have been pulling money out of bitcoin-backed exchange-traded funds. LSEG data shows the largest ETFs are set for a net monthly outflow of around $644 million, the largest since their launch back in January 2024. Sign up here.

The Conference Board said consumer confidence deteriorated in February at its fastest pace in three-and-a-half years, with estimates for 12-month domestic inflation surging amid worries that U.S. tariffs on imports would raise prices for households. Investors flocked to Treasury bonds, sending the yield on the two-year note to its lowest since November, helping real estate stocks (.SPLRCR) , opens new tab rise 1.4%.

Tuesday's consumer confidence report reinforced worries that the domestic economy is stalling and the U.S. Federal Reserve is likely to be cautious about cutting interest rates. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the economy is more fragile under the surface than economic metrics suggest. Interest-rate futures currently point to the central bank staying put on borrowing costs for the first half of the year, according to data compiled by LSEG.

The short resolution reflects Trump's upending of U.S. policy on Ukraine after taking office last month and his more conciliatory stance towards Russia. In contrast, former president Joe Biden's administration led efforts at the United Nations to support Ukraine throughout the war. Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia acknowledged \"constructive changes\" in the U.S. position on the conflict. He told the council the resolution was \"not an ideal one,\" but \"a starting point for future efforts towards peaceful settlement.\" The 15-member U.N. Security Council had been deadlocked throughout the war and unable to take any action because Russia holds a veto. But the 193-member General Assembly has repeatedly supported Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and called for a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in line with the U.N. Charter. The U.S. failed earlier on Monday to convince the General Assembly to pass the same three-paragraph resolution adopted by the Security Council. The resolution mourns the loss of life in the \"Russia-Ukraine conflict\", reiterates the U.N.'s purpose is to maintain international peace and security and peacefully settle disputes, and urges a swift end to the conflict and a lasting peace. Security Council resolutions are considered binding, while General Assembly resolutions are not. However, General Assembly resolutions carry political weight, reflecting a global view on the war. The Security Council adopted the U.S. resolution with 10 votes in favor, while France, Britain, Denmark, Greece and Slovenia abstained. Russia voted in favor after failing to amend it and vetoing European bids to add language supporting Ukraine. Item 1 of 5 Vote results are displayed during the Eleventh Emergency Special Session draft resolution meeting in the United Nations General Assembly on the 3rd anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, at the U.N. headquarters in New York, U.S., February 24, 2025.

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab \"This resolution puts us on the path to peace. It is a first step, but a crucial one – one of which we should all be proud,\" acting U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Dorothy Shea told the council. \"Now we must use it to build a peaceful future for Ukraine, Russia and the international community.\" 'NO EQUIVALENCE' However, Trump's approach to mediation has left Ukraine and European allies wary of his focus on Russia and worried they could be cut out of talks to end the war. Britain's U.N. Ambassador Barbara Woodward told the council that the terms of peace in Ukraine matter and must \"send a message that aggression does not pay.\" \"This is why there can be no equivalence between Russia and Ukraine in how this council refers to this war. If we are to find a path to sustainable peace, the council must be clear on the war's origins,\" she said. French U.N. Ambassador Nicolas de Riviere - whose President Emmanuel Macron met with Trump in Washington on Monday - said that while France was \"fully committed to peace in Ukraine, we call for comprehensive, just and lasting peace, and certainly not for capitulation of the victim.\" The General Assembly earlier adopted two resolutions, one drafted by Ukraine and Europeans and one drafted by the U.S. that was amended by the assembly to include its long-held language supporting Ukraine. Those votes gave Ukraine and European states a diplomatic victory over Washington. \"This war has never been about Ukraine only. It is about a fundamental right of any country to exist, to choose its own path and to live free from aggression,\" Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister Mariana Betsa told the assembly before the vote. The amended U.S.-drafted resolution won 93 votes in favor in the assembly, while 73 states abstained and eight voted no. Russia failed in a bid to amend the U.S. text to include a reference to the \"root causes\" of the conflict. The resolution drafted by Ukraine and European countries passed with 93 votes in favor, 65 abstentions and 18 no votes. Along with the United States, some other countries that voted no were Russia, North Korea and Israel. Sign up here.

On the eve of his departure to meet Trump in Washington, Starmer told parliament he was bringing the increase in defence spending forward to offer Europe more support as the U.S. spearheads peace talks with Russia over its war in Ukraine . With public spending already stretched in Britain, Starmer said the increase from its current 2.3% would be fully paid for by a 40% cut to international aid, an announcement he said he was not happy to make but one which was necessary to offer Ukraine and Europe support in a \"new era\". Since Trump seemingly abandoned the United States' more Ukraine-friendly approach to Russia's war, blindsiding much of Europe, Starmer and other European leaders have stepped up diplomatic efforts to show a united front to support Kyiv. \"Starting today, I can announce this government will begin the biggest sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the Cold War,\" Starmer said, adding that combined with spending on intelligence services it would reach 2.6% from 2027. \"We must go further still. I have long argued that ... all European allies must step up and do more for our own defence,\" he said. He added that Britain would set a target for spending 3% of gross domestic product in the next parliament, which will convene after a national election due in 2029. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth welcomed the spending rise after speaking to British defence minister John Healey. \"A strong step from an enduring partner,\" Hegseth said on X. The increase would see Britain spending 13.4 billion pounds ($17 billion) a year more on defence in 2027 than it does now, Starmer said, a figure which includes expected growth in GDP over the period. He told a later press conference the extra money would help rebuild Britain's industrial base, create jobs and boost growth. Britain's defence ministry said it spent 53.9 billion pounds in the 2023/24 financial year. To meet the increase in spending, the international aid budget will be cut from 0.5% of gross national income to 0.3% in 2027, meaning borrowing levels would not change, Starmer said. Britain last cut its aid budget in November 2020, during an economic crisis resulting from COVID, reducing the level to 0.5% of GNI from 0.7%, a move criticised by some development groups for diminishing the nation's global influence. Item 1 of 4 Prime Minister Keir Starmer delivers a statement on Defence spending at Downing Street on February 25, 2025 in London, England. Earlier today Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a commitment to increase the UK's defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, along with the goal of increasing it to 3% during the next parliament.

Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Read more \"This is a short-sighted and appalling move,\" said Romilly Greenhill, chief executive officer of Bond, a network for organisations working in international development and humanitarian assistance. PRE-TRUMP VISIT GAMBIT Starmer's statement was a clear opening gambit before meeting Trump in Washington, signalling Britain will try to lead other European countries in offering more support to the U.S.-led military NATO alliance - a demand Trump has repeatedly made, suggesting nations should spend 5% of GDP. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has also called on member states to step up defence spending beyond their common goal of 2% of national output set a decade ago. According to NATO, Britain was the third-largest spender in cash terms in 2024, behind the United States and Germany. Germany's likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz , has pledged to significantly raise defence spending but will need to navigate the possibility of far-right and left parties blocking his plans. Starmer heads to Washington, hoping to reassure Trump that Europe will provide support and security guarantees to Kyiv if peace talks with Russia are successful. The British leader has said he is open to British troops providing security guarantees to Ukraine alongside other European nations. Starmer also wants some form of U.S. \"backstop\" for any security guarantee from Europe, which, he says, \"will be vital to deter Russia from launching another invasion in just a few years' time\". \"The U.S. is our most important bilateral alliance,\" he said. \"So this week when I meet President Trump I will be clear. I want this relationship to go from strength to strength.\" He will be the second European leader to meet Trump in Washington since the president stunned its allies with his new approach to the three-year Ukraine war. French President Emmanuel Macron held a good-humoured meeting with Trump on Monday when the two agreed on the deployment of European peacekeeping forces, although the French leader did not get a firm nod that the U.S. would play a role. But underlining the difference in approach between the U.S. and Europe, Macron also corrected Trump's assertion that European nations had delivered all of their aid to Ukraine as loans, saying countries had given \"real money, to be clear\". Starmer will hope that by offering to increase defence spending he might be better able to secure a promise that Washington will provide a backstop for European nations.

During a day of talks between the two leaders, Trump and Macron showed a friendly rapport based on years of good ties. But Macron made clear he disagreed with Trump on some key issues as they marked three years since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Trump refused to refer to Russian President Vladimir Putin as a dictator, after calling Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy a dictator last week. Macron said it was clear that Russia \"is the aggressor\" in the conflict, a topic Trump wavered on last week. \"President Putin violated the peace,\" Macron said at a joint press conference with Trump. Trump expressed a desire for a ceasefire as soon as possible and said he was trying to arrange one between Ukraine and Russia. He said he could go to Moscow to meet Putin once a deal is reached. Macron, on the other hand, urged a more deliberate approach, starting with a truce and then a peace deal that includes security guarantees. \"We want peace, he wants peace. We want peace swiftly, but we don't want an agreement that is weak,\" Macron told reporters. Any peace deal, he said, must be \"assessed, checked and verified.\" The two leaders did agree, however, on the deployment of European peacekeeping forces once a peace deal is eventually reached. \"They would not be along the front lines. They would not be part of any conflict. They would be there to ensure that the peace is respected,\" Macron said earlier in the Oval Office with Trump.

REUTERS/Brian Snyder Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Trump said he accepts the concept, as does Putin. \"Yeah, he will accept that,\" Trump said about Putin's position on a peacekeeping force. \"I specifically asked him that question. He has no problem with it.\" Macron, the first European leader to visit Trump since he regained power a month ago, called his discussions with Trump \"a turning point\" in the drive for a more unified approach. Macron is trying to capitalize on a relationship with Trump built during their first presidential terms. The French leader showed how he has managed to deal with the unpredictable Trump without alienating him. At one point during their Oval Office meeting, Macron touched Trump's arm and carefully corrected the U.S. president's claim that Europe had delivered all of its aid as loans. Trump reported progress on reaching a revenue-sharing agreement with Ukraine on Ukrainian minerals as a way to recoup the cost of weaponry pumped into Ukraine by the previous Biden administration. Trump said he expected Zelenskiy to come to the United States this week or next week to seal the agreement. Trump and his team have been negotiating a minerals revenue-sharing agreement with Ukraine to recoup some of the money that the previous Biden administration had sent to Kyiv in the form of weapons to repel Russia. Zelenskiy last week rejected U.S. demands for $500 billion in mineral wealth from Ukraine to repay Washington for wartime aid, saying the United States had supplied nowhere near that sum so far and offered no specific security guarantees in the agreement. Trump, asked if it was possible that Ukraine might have to cede some territory to Russia, said, \"Well, we're going to see.\" Macron said any deal should include sovereignty for Ukraine. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer also is to visit Trump later in the week, amid alarm in Europe over Trump's hardening stance toward Ukraine and overtures to Moscow on the conflict. Sign up here.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Summary Companies DeepSeek likely to release next-generation R2 model before May - sources Startup shuns typical Chinese tech giant culture, is known for flat hierarchy China embraces DeepSeek after initial regulatory concerns about its mass chip purchases Firm instructed to keep low-profile amid global concerns about its privacy practices BEIJING/HONG KONG/SINGAPORE, Feb 25 (Reuters) - DeepSeek is looking to press home its advantage. The Chinese startup triggered a $1 trillion-plus sell-off in global equities markets last month with a cut-price AI reasoning model that outperformed many Western competitors. Now, the Hangzhou-based firm is accelerating the launch of the successor to January's R1 model, according to three people familiar with the company. Deepseek had planned to release R2 in early May but now wants it out as early as possible, two of them said, without providing specifics. The company says it hopes the new model will produce better coding and be able to reason in languages beyond English. Details of the accelerated timeline for R2's release have not been previously reported. DeepSeek did not respond to a request for comment for this story. Rivals are still digesting the implications of R1, which was built with less-powerful Nvidia chips but is competitive with those developed at the costs of hundreds of billions of dollars by U.S. tech giants. \"The launch of DeepSeek's R2 model could be a pivotal moment in the AI industry,\" said Vijayasimha Alilughatta, chief operating officer of Indian tech services provider Zensar. DeepSeek's success at creating cost-effective AI models \"would likely spur companies worldwide to accelerate their own efforts ... breaking the stranglehold of the few dominant players in the field,\" he said. R2 is likely to worry the U.S. government, which has identified leadership of AI as a national priority. Its release may further galvanize Chinese authorities and companies, dozens of which say they have started integrating DeepSeek models into their products. Little is known about DeepSeek, whose founder Liang Wenfeng became a billionaire through his quantitative hedge fund High-Flyer. Liang, who was described by a former employer as \"low-key and introverted,\" has not spoken to any media since July 2024. Reuters interviewed a dozen former employees, as well as quant fund professionals knowledgeable about the operations of DeepSeek and its parent company High-Flyer. It also reviewed state media articles, social-media posts from the companies and research papers dating back to 2019. They told a story of a company that functioned more like a research lab than a for-profit enterprise and was unencumbered by the hierarchical traditions of China's high-pressure tech industry, even as it became responsible for what many investors see as the latest breakthrough in AI. DIFFERENT PATH Liang was born in 1985 in a rural village in the southern province of Guangdong. He later obtained communication engineering degrees at the elite Zhejiang University. One of his first jobs was running a research department at a smart imaging firm in Shanghai. His then-boss, Zhou Chaoen, told state media on Feb. 9 that Liang had hired prize-winning algorithm engineers and operated with a \"flat management style.\" At DeepSeek and High-Flyer, Liang has similarly shunned the practices of Chinese tech giants known for rigid top-down management, low pay for young employees and \"996\" - working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week. Liang opened his Beijing office within walking distance of Tsinghua University and Peking University, China's two most prestigious education institutions. He regularly delved into technical details and was happy to work alongside Gen-Z interns and recent graduates that comprised the bulk of its workforce, according to two former employees. They also described usually working eight-hour days in a collaborative atmosphere. \"Liang gave us control and treated us as experts. He constantly asked questions and learned alongside us,\" said 26-year-old researcher Benjamin Liu, who left the company in September. \"DeepSeek allowed me to take ownership of critical parts of the pipeline, which was very exciting.\" Liang did not respond to questions sent via DeepSeek. While Baidu and other Chinese tech giants were racing to build their consumer-facing versions of ChatGPT in 2023 and profit off of the global AI boom, Liang told Chinese media outlet Waves last year that he deliberately avoided spending heavily on app development, focusing instead on refining the AI model's quality. Both DeepSeek and High-Flyer are known for paying generously, according to three people familiar with its compensation practices. At High-Flyer, it is not uncommon for a senior data scientist to make 1.5 million yuan annually, while competitors rarely pay more than 800,000, said one of the people, a rival quant fund manager who knows Liang. The largesse was funded by High-Flyer, which became one of China's most successful quant funds and, even after a government crackdown on the sector, still manages tens of billions of yuan, according to two people in the industry. COMPUTING POWER DeepSeek's success with a low-cost AI model is based on High-Flyer's decade-long and substantial investment in research and computing power, three people said. The quant fund was an earlier pioneer in AI trading and a top executive said in 2020 that High-Flyer was going \"all in\" on AI by re-investing 70% of its revenue, mostly into AI research. High-Flyer spent 1.2 billion yuan on two supercomputing AI clusters in 2020 and 2021. The second cluster, Fire-Flyer II, was made up of around 10,000 Nvidia A100 chips, used for training AI models. DeepSeek had not been established at that time, so the accumulation of computing power caught the attention of Chinese securities regulators, said a person with direct knowledge of officials' thinking. \"Regulators wanted to know why they need so many chips?\" the person said. \"How they were going to use it? What kind of impact would that have on the market?\" Authorities decided not to intervene, in a move that would prove crucial for DeepSeek's fortunes: the U.S. banned the export of A100 chips to China in 2022, at which point Fire-Flyer II was already in operation. Beijing now celebrates DeepSeek, but has instructed it not to engage with the media without approval, according to a person familiar with Chinese official thinking. Authorities had asked Liang to keep a low-profile because they were worried that too much hype in the media would draw unnecessary attention, the person said. China's cabinet and commerce ministry, as well as China's securities regulator, did not respond to requests for comment. As one of the few companies with a large A100 cluster, High-Flyer and DeepSeek were able to attract some of China's best research talent, two former employees said. \"The key advantage of vast (computing) resources is that it allows for large-scale experimentation,\" said Liu, the former employee. Some Western AI entrepreneurs, like Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, have claimed that DeepSeek had as many as 50,000 higher-end Nvidia chips that are banned for export to China. He has not produced evidence for the allegation or responded to Reuters' requests to provide proof. DeepSeek has not responded to Wang's claims. Two former employees attributed the company's success to Liang's focus on more cost-effective AI architecture . The startup used techniques like Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and multihead latent attention (MLA), which incur far lower computing costs, its research papers show. The MoE technique divides an AI model into different areas of expertise and activates only those related to a query, as opposed to more common architectures that use the entire model. MLA architecture allows a model to process different aspects of one piece of information simultaneously, helping it detect key details more effectively. While competitors like France's Mistral have developed models based on MoE, DeepSeek was the first firm to depend heavily on this architecture while achieving parity with more expensively built models. DeepSeek's pricing was 20 to 40 times cheaper than what OpenAI charged for equivalent models, analysts at Bernstein brokerage estimated in early February. For now, Western and Chinese tech giants have signaled plans to continue heavy AI spending, but DeepSeek's success with R1 and its earlier V3 model has prompted some to alter strategies. OpenAI cut prices this month, while Google's Gemini has introduced discounted tiers of access. Since R1's launch, OpenAI has also released an O3-Mini model that relies on less computing power. Adnan Masood of U.S. tech services provider UST told Reuters that his laboratory had run benchmarks that found R1 often used three times as many tokens, or units of data processed by the AI model, for reasoning as OpenAI's scaled-down model. STATE EMBRACE Even before R1 gripped global attention, there were signs that DeepSeek had caught Beijing's favor. In January, state media reported that Liang attended a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing as the designated representative of the AI sector, ahead of the leaders of better-known firms. The subsequent fanfare over the cost competitiveness of its models has buoyed Beijing's belief that it can out-innovate the U.S., with Chinese companies and government bodies embracing DeepSeek models at a pace that has not been offered to other firms. At least 13 Chinese city governments and 10 state-owned energy companies say they have deployed DeepSeek into their systems, while tech giants Lenovo (0992.HK) , opens new tab , Baidu (9888.HK) , opens new tab and Tencent (0700.HK) , opens new tab - owner of China's largest social media app WeChat - have integrated DeepSeek's models into their products. Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Li \"have signalled they endorse DeepSeek,\" said Alfred Wu, an expert on Chinese policymaking at Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. \"Now everyone just endorses it.\" The Chinese embrace comes as governments from South Korea to Italy remove DeepSeek from national app stores, citing privacy concerns. \"If DeepSeek becomes the go-to AI model across Chinese state entities, Western regulators might see this as another reason to escalate restrictions on AI chips or software collaborations,\" said Stephen Wu, an AI expert and founder of hedge fund Carthage Capital. Further limits on advanced AI chips are a challenge that Liang has acknowledged. \"Our problem has never been funding,\" he told Waves in July. \"It's the embargo on high-end chips.\" Sign up here.

REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Companies Apple Inc Follow Alphabet Inc Follow Amazon.com Inc Follow Show more companies Feb 25 (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O) , opens new tab shareholders voted to keep the tech giant's diversity, equity and inclusion policies at an annual meeting on Tuesday, a win for management which had opposed efforts by a conservative group to scrap the program. The vote was seen as a test of shareholder views about the value of DEI programs, which many companies added or beefed up starting in 2020 amid the Black Lives Matter movement. A growing conservative backlash has pushed major U.S. companies, including Meta (META.O) , opens new tab and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) , opens new tab , to drop DEI initiatives ahead of and following Donald Trump's return to the U.S. presidency. Trump has criticized corporate DEI programs, suggesting the U.S. Department of Justice could investigate whether they violate the law. The National Center for Public Policy Research, which describes itself as a free-market think-tank, had submitted the proposal titled \"Request to Cease DEI Efforts\" to the shareholder meeting. Proponents of the proposal argued that recent legal changes meant Apple would see an increase in discrimination cases if it continued DEI policies. Apple said it had an active oversight effort to avoid legal risks and that the proposal inappropriately restricted management. Apple shareholders have in the past rejected proposals that would have required the company to disclose more about racial and gender pay gaps. On Tuesday, Cook said Apple has never had quotas or targets in its diversity programs. \"As the legal landscape around these issues evolves, we may need to make some changes to comply, but our North Star of dignity and respect for everyone and our work to that end will never waver,\" Cook said. The same group had asked Costco Wholesale to report on the risks of maintaining its DEI initiatives. The membership-only retailer's shareholders voted strongly against the proposal at a meeting in January. On Monday, Apple highlighted its spending in the United States, saying it planned $500 billion in investments in the next four years, drawing praise from Trump days after media reported that CEO Tim Cook had met with the president. Apple shareholders also voted against a proposal asking the company to prepare a report assessing the risks of its work with AI, while all management proposals were approved, a preliminary tally of the vote count showed. Cook said on Tuesday that Apple would be the biggest customer of a Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW) , opens new tab factory in Arizona that Trump helped bring to the United States during his first term.

Stocks with so much swagger that they earned a nickname conjured from Hollywood’s golden age. As a group, Alphabet , Amazon , Apple , Meta , Microsoft , Nvidia and Tesla have racked up the lion’s share of the market’s gains in recent years, roaring to nearly one-third of the S&P 500’s total capitalization. That dominant run prompted a Bank of America analyst to dub them “The Magnificent Seven,” a nod to a 1960 Western about a gang of gunslingers led by Steve McQueen, Yul Brynner and Charles Bronson. The moniker quickly became part of the parlance , appearing all over the press and spawning a spinoff exchange-traded fund . Will the star stocks continue to inspire investors? Or is this generation’s tech boom driven by the same “irrational exuberance” that inflated bubbles of the past? This live dashboard updates with the latest market data, offering a real-time view of what comes next for the sizzling U.S. technology stocks. Stock performance The Magnificent Seven’s tickers can be combined to track the group’s total value over time. In the early months of 2025, the septet has trailed the hundreds of other stocks in the S&P 500 index. But if you extend your view further back, you can see that the club has climbed significantly more than the rest of the market over the long term. Some of the seven are having a better time than others. Chipmaker Nvidia is booming thanks to its lucrative position as the dominant chip supplier to artificial intelligence innovators, while shares of the electric vehicle maker Tesla seesaw as investors vacillate on its prospects for growth as CEO Elon Musk plays a leading role in the second Trump administration. Trading Momentum To get a sense of the market‘s direction, Wall Street analysts compare a stock’s current cost to its trading position in recent weeks and months. A peaking stock will climb up the scale, while a stock losing steam will gradually sink. Watching these metrics over time can help identify when a trend is reversing. According to one rule of thumb , values that rank in the top 20% are considered at risk of gravity‘s pull, while those in the bottom 20% may be ready to rise. The same momentum score, which runs from zero to 100, can be calculated for each member of The Magnificent Seven. While many traders employ this type of statistical analysis, it’s only one way to measure the market. A competing school of thought prefers to focus on bottom-line numbers like sales, costs and profits. Market Share After years of gains, The Magnificent Seven now account for an outsized share of the S&P 500’s total value. Analysts refer to this heavy concentration of capital in a small number of stocks as a narrow market . When a handful of companies have the power to swing the overall index, they can increase volatility and, should the goliaths falter, lead to sudden, sharp declines. Revenue Growth Investors have flocked to The Magnificent Seven with hopes that artificial intelligence will power continued expansion. You can keep tabs on whether they keep growing by watching the revenue numbers posted each quarter. Like stock values, the figures can be combined to examine the group’s overall performance. As with stock prices, the numbers can be split out to analyze each of the seven individually. Sign up here.

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab WASHINGTON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - U.S. single-family house prices increased solidly in December, despite improving supply, which together with elevated mortgage rates will continue to erode affordability. House prices rose 0.4% on a month-on-month basis after an upwardly revised 0.4% increase in November, the Federal Housing Finance Agency said on Tuesday. Prices were initially reported to have climbed 0.3% in November. They increased 4.7% in the 12 months through December, following an upwardly revised 4.5% gain in November, which was previously reported as a 4.2% rise. The strong increase in prices was despite rising housing supply, which is being driven by ebbing demand amid higher mortgage rates. House prices increased 4.5% from the fourth quarter of 2023 through the fourth quarter of 2024. The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage hovered just under 7% in December, data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac showed. New housing supply is at a 17-year high. While the stock of previously owned homes on the market remains below pre-pandemic levels, inventory has increased significantly. Data last week showed a plunge in existing home sales in January. The rise in monthly house prices was led by the Middle Atlantic region, which recorded a 0.8% surge. But prices dipped 0.1% in the West North Central and West South Central regions. All census regions reported annual house price gains in December, with New England and the Middle Atlantic regions leading the pack. There were moderate price increases in the West South Central and Pacific regions. Sign up here.

REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Summary Bessent blames Biden's deficit spending, over-regulation for 'sticky inflation' U.S. tariffs can rebuild manufacturing, grow revenues, address imbalances-Bessent WASHINGTON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Tuesday argued that the U.S. economy is more fragile under the surface than economic metrics suggest and vowed to \"re-privatize\" growth by cutting government spending and regulation. In his first major economic policy address at the Australian embassy in Washington, Bessent said that interest rate volatility, sticky inflation and reliance on the public sector for job growth have hobbled the U.S. economy despite positive top-line GDP growth and low unemployment. In the wide-ranging speech, Bessent blamed \"prolific overspending\" under former President Joe Biden and regulations that have hindered supply-side growth as the main drivers of \"sticky inflation.\" \"The previous administration's over-reliance on excessive government spending and overbearing regulation left us with an economy that may have exhibited some reasonable metrics but ultimately was brittle underneath,\" he said. Bessent said that 95% of all job growth in the past 12 months has been concentrated in public and government-adjacent sectors such as health care and education, jobs offering slower wage growth and less productivity than private-sector jobs. Meanwhile, he said jobs in manufacturing, metals, mining and information technology all contracted or flatlined over the same period. \"The private sector has been in recession,\" Bessent said. \"Our goal is to re-privatize the economy.\" Bessent said President Donald Trump's administration was working to bolster the private sector's contribution to job creation, partly by slashing regulations, extending tax cuts and rebalancing the U.S. economy through tariff policies. Bessent said Trump's planned tariffs were an essential part of this plan, with three main goals. \"First, tariffs can increase U.S. industrial capacity, create and protect U.S. jobs, and improve our national security, he said. \"Second, tariffs can be an important source of government revenue, which can help fund investments that benefit American families and companies.\" He also cited it as a tool to correct and manage internal imbalances in other economies, and deter excess production and supply from other countries, such as China. He said that China could not be allowed to export deflation to major Western economies as it struggles with its own internal economic problems. \"China really needs more consumption,\" he said. In deciding on reciprocal tariff rates, Trump's administration, including the Treasury, will examine a wide range of factors, including other countries' tariff rates, non-tariff barriers and currency practices, Bessent said. Asked about how Australia, which has a free-trade agreement with the U.S., was doing in this regard, Bessent said, \"so far, so good, but I'm not USTR.\" He said he discussed Australia's request to be exempted from Trump's restored 25% global steel and aluminum tariffs during a meeting with Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers. He added however that that was a matter for the Commerce Department and USTR to decide. Sign up here.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Summary Consumer confidence index dives to eight-month low One-year inflation expectations highest in over 1-1/2 years Survey notes mentions of tariffs at levels unseen in six years WASHINGTON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence deteriorated at its sharpest pace in 3-1/2 years in February while 12-month inflation expectations surged, offering further signs that Americans were growing anxious about the potential negative impact on the economy of President Donald Trump's policies. The Conference Board survey on Tuesday noted that \"comments on the current administration and its policies dominated the responses.\" It followed on the heels of surveys last week showing steep declines in business and consumer sentiment in February. Tariffs on imports, which Trump has already imposed or is planning to, have been singled out as the major issue in almost every survey of households and businesses. Economists said unprecedented layoffs of federal government workers were also taking a toll on consumers' psyche, which they said posed a risk to spending, the main engine of the economy. \"Americans are increasingly pessimistic about the outlook. No Federal government has ever before threatened government workers with mass firings and it is starting to scare the daylights out of consumers,\" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS. \"The economy could well ground to a halt in the first quarter of the year as consumers stay home.\" The Conference Board's consumer confidence index dropped 7 points, the biggest decline since August 2021, to 98.3 this month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling but only to 102.5. The third straight monthly decrease pushed the index to the lowest level since June 2024. It is now at the bottom of the range that has prevailed since 2022. \"There was a sharp increase in the mentions of trade and tariffs, back to a level unseen since 2019,\" said Stephanie Guichard, senior economist, global indicators at The Conference Board. \"Most notably, comments on the current administration and its policies dominated the responses.\" Business and consumer sentiment soared following Trump's November 5 victory on hopes for a less-stringent regulatory environment, tax cuts and low inflation. Trump, a Republican, has during his first month in office slapped an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports. A 25% levy on imports from Mexico and Canada was suspended until March. Trump this month raised tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 25%. This is a line chart that shows a consumer confidence index over the past 20 years. In the month of February, the overall index was 98.3, the view of the current economy was 136.5 and expectations for the future were 72.9. MASS FIRINGS Tariffs on automobiles, semiconductors and pharmaceutical imports are looming. At the same time, tens of thousands of federal government workers, mostly those on probation, have been fired by billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE - an entity created by Trump. U.S. stocks fell on the confidence data. The dollar eased against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields slipped. Though economists are not yet predicting a recession, they expect a long period of very slow economic growth and high inflation. That would put the Federal Reserve in a difficult spot. The U.S. central bank paused cutting interest rates in January while policymakers monitored the economic impact of the Trump administration's policies. The Fed has reduced its benchmark overnight interest rate by 100 basis points since September, when it embarked on its policy easing cycle. It hiked the policy rate by 5.25 percentage points in 2022 and 2023 to tame inflation. Consumers' average 12-month inflation expectations jumped to 6%, the highest since May 2023, from 5.2% in February. The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get declined to 17.1 from 19.4 last month. This measure correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's monthly employment report. Sign up here.

REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Summary Effectiveness of Fed's dual mandate post-pandemic questioned Panel says will review Fed's monetary policy framework Critics argue Fed's focus has drifted from price stability WASHINGTON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - The head of a new congressional panel gearing up to strengthen Capitol Hill's oversight of the Federal Reserve plans a broad review of how the U.S. central bank makes its interest rate decisions, including whether controlling inflation should be prioritized over safeguarding employment. \"A substantial number of my Financial Services Committee colleagues and the chairman want to discuss that issue,\" Representative Frank Lucas, an Oklahoma Republican, told Reuters in an interview on Monday ahead of next week's first hearing of the Monetary Policy, Treasury Market Resilience, and Economic Prosperity Task Force. \"Is there really a dual mandate? And how does that affect the primary mandate of price stability?\" The Fed's dual mandate - to foster price stability and maximum employment - was imposed by Congress in 1978, and right now it is close to both goals: The unemployment rate is 4% and inflation has eased to 2.6% relative to a 2% target, a far better outcome than many feared. But the experience following the COVID-19 pandemic, with inflation surging to 40-year highs and the Fed scrambling to beat it with rapid rate hikes, has left scars. Lucas, a three-decade congressional veteran, is keen to explore whether the Fed's approach was flawed. Across a series of hearings in coming months, he will also look at longstanding issues like whether the Fed should make more use of monetary policy rules in its decisions, perhaps not to the full exclusion of its own discretion but as a way to give the public more certainty about the direction of policy. \"If your primary focus is price stability, and if you want the forces of the economy to be able to make decisions, then a more rules-focused process provides certainty to that,\" Lucas said. Lucas acknowledged the difficulty of amending the Federal Reserve Act given narrow Republican majorities in the House and Senate, and the nearly 50-year legacy of the dual mandate, but he expects his process potentially to lead to recommended legislation, a series of reports, or recommendations to the Fed. That is timely, he said, given the Fed is currently conducting its own review of an operating framework that in 2020 intensified its focus on joblessness - and which some argue slowed its response to price pressures that began building in 2021. \"These issues are relevant right now,\" he said. Along with monetary policy, the panel - composed of eight Republicans and six Democrats - will look at issues around the functioning of the U.S. Treasury market. \"TOO MANY DISTRACTING 'MANDATES'\" The Lucas task force adds a new layer of oversight to what may already be a sensitive Fed discussion about whether to keep changes made in 2020 to its monetary policy framework. Adopted amid the high unemployment and stress of the early pandemic and following years of chronically low inflation, the changes tilted the Fed's focus towards jobs, declared maximum employment a \"broad-based and inclusive goal,\" and made other changes cheered at the time by labor advocates. But it also led to a strict set of tests for raising rates, which the Fed did not do until March 2022 after months of dismissing rising prices as \"transitory\" and calling the jobs recovery incomplete. While it's not clear how much difference an earlier Fed response would have made, the language in the new framework - promising to use periods of high inflation to balance low ones, for example - remains a focus of critics who say the Fed's priorities have drifted. \"For far too long, we have witnessed too many distracting ‘mandates’ diluting the Federal Reserve’s core mission of price stability,\" Financial Services Committee Chair and Arkansas Republican French Hill said last month in launching the task force. Concern over Fed \"mandate creep\" has been intense among congressional Republicans who view its research and discussion around issues like climate change and economic inequality as an inappropriate distraction in setting monetary policy. Fed officials contend they need to understand broad sets of issues in order to make effective decisions, while Chair Jerome Powell has tried to square the circle by arguing that controlling inflation is perhaps more important for poorer families than it is for wealthier ones. Still, the criticism has resonated at the Fed, with the framework review occurring in the midst not just of the new task force's work, but also in the context of a broader backlash from President Donald Trump's administration to what he refers to as \"woke\" policies. The 2020 changes were seen then as a rational move given the importance of offsetting pandemic job losses. The prior decade's experience had convinced policymakers that the labor market could be tighter, with lower unemployment, than previously believed without stoking inflation. The extended run of near-zero interest rates and tepid inflation led officials to conclude more was needed to ensure inflation and public inflation expectations centered on the Fed's target over time. The approach, dubbed Flexible Average Inflation Targeting, promised higher inflation episodes to offset periods of weakness as a way to keep interest rates away from zero and avoid the risk of outright deflation. But Hill opened a recent hearing chiding Powell that the strategy \"in hindsight...appears ill-timed and ill-fitted for a post-pandemic world.\" Echoing Hill's comment, Fed officials themselves have \"noted...that the current economic environment differed greatly\" from the \"low inflation and interest rates\" that drove the 2020 revisions, according to minutes of last month's meeting. \"In light of the experience of the past five years, participants assessed that it was important to consider potential revisions.\" Sign up here.

By Reuters February 25, 2025 4:33 PM UTC Updated ago Text Small Text Medium Text Large Text Share X Facebook Linkedin Email Link Demonstrators rally during a protest against billionaire Elon Musk, who is heading U.S. President Donald Trump's drive to shrink the federal government, outside the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in Washington, U.S., February 5, 2025. REUTERS/Nathan Howard/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Feb 25 (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of U.S. government workers have been fired in recent weeks, according to a Reuters tally of announcements tracking President Donald Trump's plan to shrink the federal workforce. So far, few indications of those lost jobs have appeared in the various formal measures of the U.S. job market. Economists will be keeping an eye on the data because federal government hiring has been a steady contributor to overall U.S. employment growth as the pace of private-sector hiring has eased. Over the last two years through January, the ranks of non-U.S. Postal Service federal workers as a share of overall payroll employment has edged up to 1.52% from 1.47%. Despite that rise, the federal civilian worker share of total U.S. employment is near its historic low of 1.4% from late 2000. The federal workforce share peaked at just over 4% in the early 1950s. Also, Trump's cuts - being carried out under the direction of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency - have not just been aimed at those directly on government payrolls but also at private companies and individuals performing contract work for the government. A 2020 Brookings Institution study , opens new tab estimated that for every one federal employee there are two contractors. With that in mind, Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, , opens new tab estimated that with a \"consensus\" estimate of ultimately 300,000 DOGE-related federal job cuts, the total employment reduction could be closer to 1 million. So when will these reductions start to materialize in the official data? Here's a guide: Shows federal worker share of employment WEEKLY JOBLESS CLAIMS Each Thursday, the Labor Department's Employment and Training Administration reports the number of people who the previous week had filed for state unemployment benefits for the first time. The report includes a running tally of all those who continue to collect benefits beyond one week, a figure called \"continued claims\" and reported with a one-week lag. Federal employees who have lost their jobs, though, are not included in the state claims data. They are tracked separately under the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE) program, and the data is reported with a one-week lag. In the latest week ended February 8, 613 initial claims had been filed by former federal workers, and that figure has not climbed above 1,000 in more than two years. It also remains below the level typically seen during comparable seasons in the years immediately before the COVID-19 pandemic. In the previous week, 7,110 former federal workers were receiving continued benefits, around the same number seen at this time of year in the last two years. Moreover, those continued claims tended to be much higher during comparable times of year before the pandemic. Shows unemployment claims by federal workers Since the Trump and Musk cuts are not aimed only at those earning a government paycheck, some indications of the extent of job losses may start appearing soon in data from individual states with high concentrations of jobs supported by federal government activities. Washington and the neighboring states of Maryland and Virginia are home to hundreds of thousands of workers whose employers perform work under federal contracts, making them key locations to watch. Only Washington has shown an uptrend in new benefits filings. In the latest week ended February 15, the advance number of new filings was about 1,700 and the highest in nearly two years. It is also well above the level typically seen in the years just before the pandemic, with the exception of a short-lived spike in January 2019 due to a government shutdown over a budget impasse. New claims in Maryland and Virginia, meanwhile, have both averaged about 2,800 per week since Trump took office on January 20, both within the trend range over the last year. Texas, Florida, California and Georgia also have high numbers of federal workers and associated contractors. Shows jobless claims in Washington, Maryland and Virginia There are some caveats. Not everyone who loses a job is eligible for jobless benefits, and this includes certain contract workers. So some job losses will never appear in the weekly claims data. Also, not everyone files for benefits immediately after losing a job - or at all. Many people don't file for a week or more after their job was eliminated, and some among them will find new work promptly and never have a need to seek government support. That said, a generally slowing job market may mean that final dynamic is less at play this time around. NONFARM PAYROLLS Each month, typically on the first Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports the U.S. employment situation, which updates the unemployment rate as well as the total level of employment and levels and changes by sector, including local, state and federal government employment. The next report is due on March 7, covering February. It is based on a survey conducted during the week when the 12th day of the month falls. In this case, that was a week when news reports about firings within the federal government began circulating widely, so there is a chance that the level of non-USPS civilian employment was affected by that development. Net federal hiring outside the postal service totaled 3,700 in January. It has averaged about 5,700 a month over the last two years and has shrunk in just one month in that span. It is unclear whether the reports of firings that surfaced during the week of February 9-16 would have been made official and reported in that week's BLS survey. Trump shrunk federal civilian employment by about 17,000 workers in his first year of office during his first term, including about 13,000 in his first three months. But it began growing again, and by the time the pandemic struck he had overseen an expansion in the federal workforce of 60,000 people. Shows federal job openings, hiring and firing JOB OPENINGS AND LABOR TURNOVER SURVEY The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) measures the number of posted job vacancies on the last day of each month, and also estimates the monthly number of gross hirings and job separations, including people who quit, are laid off, or leave for another reason such as retirement. It is not as timely as the payrolls report. The next report, for instance, will be issued on March 11, covering January. As a snapshot of where things stood at the end of the month, it could reflect Trump's January 20 hiring freeze order, which directed that all job postings be removed and many job offers rescinded. The latest figure, for December, showed 140,000 federal government job vacancies, roughly in line with the monthly average over the term of former President Joe Biden. Monthly federal openings totaled about 110,000 during Trump's first term from January 2017 to January 2021. Gross federal hiring, meanwhile, totaled 30,000 in December - unchanged for three months and the lowest number since May 2018. STATE AND LOCAL PAYROLLS REPORTS The BLS also provides monthly state and local employment reports. The next State Employment and Unemployment report will be issued on March 17, covering January. This report shows employment levels, job gains and losses and unemployment rates across all 50 states, Washington, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It shows government employment levels but combines state, local and federal government figures. Still, it will be another resource for indications of government contractors shedding jobs, especially in areas of high concentrations of these employers. However, it is not likely that this will make itself evident before the report for February is issued in mid-April. The Metropolitan Area Employment and Unemployment Summary, meanwhile, tracks employment across nearly 400 metropolitan areas across the U.S. This has an even longer delay, of two months, and shows payroll employment levels, changes and jobless rates but does not show employment sector activity. The earliest this might be expected to reflect the effects of federal firings at the local level will be in late April when the report for February is issued. Sign up here.

REUTERS/Nathan Howard TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Summary Companies Twenty-one DOGE employees resign in protest Musk defiant in wake of federal agency setback Renews threat to fire workers who don’t respond Demands spark confusion across U.S. government WASHINGTON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Federal workers faced fresh uncertainty on Tuesday about their futures after Elon Musk gave them \"another chance\" to respond to his ultimatum that they justify their jobs or risk termination, contradicting guidance from some Trump administration officials that the request was voluntary. The confusing back-and-forth has rippled through the federal bureaucracy, with some agencies such as the U.S. Treasury Department instructing workers to comply, while others such as the Pentagon have not. It has become a test of how much power Musk wields over the U.S. government's operations as he pursues an unprecedented cost-cutting campaign with the backing of President Donald Trump . Twenty-one workers resigned from his so-called Department of Government Efficiency in protest on Tuesday, saying in a letter that they refused to cooperate with the downsizing effort . \"We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans' sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services,\" the employees wrote in a resignation posted online. There was no immediate comment from DOGE on the resignations. The workers, who include data scientists, product managers, designers and the division head of IT, were employed in an office that was known as the United States Digital Service before Musk took it over and renamed it after a favorite cryptocurrency. The staffers said the firings have undercut efforts to improve tax filing, veterans' benefits and other critical services. The resignations added to the drama surrounding Musk's email demand, which was sent to employees across the government over the weekend asking them to summarize their accomplishments of the past week by Monday. In a post on X, the social media site Musk owns, the tech billionaire asserted that failure to respond would be considered a resignation. With the deadline approaching on Monday, the Office of Personnel Management, the government's human resources arm run by Musk aides, told workers they could ignore the email. Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, was undeterred. \"Subject to the discretion of the president, they will be given another chance. Failure to respond a second time will result in termination,\" he wrote on X late on Monday. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Musk's remarks. Prior to the new OPM guidance, Trump told reporters on Monday that workers who did not respond would be \"sort of semi-fired,\" adding to the uncertainty . OPM meanwhile turned its attention to senior managers in the civil service on Tuesday. Acting agency head Chris Ezell published a memo requiring poorly performing managers to be fired and directing their superiors to evaluate them in part on how well they advanced the president's goals. NEW FISSURES IN TRUMP ADMINISTRATION The head-spinning developments exposed new fissures within Trump's administration over Musk's blunt-force approach. Even some Trump loyalists, such as Kash Patel , the newly installed FBI chief, told their employees to hold off on replying. Employees at the General Services Administration, which oversees government real estate, were still unsure how to respond to Musk's email on Tuesday after getting conflicting advice from their managers. On Monday morning, Stephen Ehikian, GSA's acting administrator, told employees to comply. Hours later, some workers received a message saying OPM's request was voluntary, but that GSA leadership was still \"encouraging\" workers to respond. An employee at the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management told Reuters that some Interior officials ordered them to respond, while the bureau's leadership said it was voluntary. The employee said they felt compelled to submit a reply despite the inconsistent guidance. The Department of Health and Human Services advised employees that if they chose to reply, they should keep their responses general and refrain from identifying specific drugs or contracts they are working on, according to an email reviewed by Reuters. \"Assume that what you write will be read by malign foreign actors and tailor your response accordingly,\" the email said. The head of the Small Business Administration, Kelly Loeffler, backed Musk's email requirement in a Fox News interview on Tuesday. EMAILS TO WORKERS \"We just want to know: Are there people there doing their jobs? And again, the bar is so low it's laughable,\" Loeffler said. \"I look forward to making sure that we get all the responses back, and for those that we don't, we'll have decisions to make.\" The acting director of OPM itself sent an email to the agency's staff that said responding with bullet points was voluntary \"but strongly encouraged.\" At the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the government's weather forecaster, a deputy on Monday instructed workers to email their supervisors with a generic list of their accomplishments, including \"100% of the tasks and duties required of me by my position description,\" a source told Reuters. Musk's downsizing initiative has led to the layoff of more than 20,000 workers . The administration has separately offered buyouts to 75,000 employees. The vast majority of terminations have involved \"probationary employees\" who started their positions less than a year ago and enjoy fewer legal job protections than the career civil servants who make up most of the 2.3 million-strong federal workforce. But OPM has begun firing career workers within its own agency in a rapid-fire process that sources told Reuters is intended to serve as a template for a second round of mass layoffs across the government. OPM has moved unusually quickly to demonstrate to other agencies what can be done, one source said. On Monday, a group of labor unions that have sued over the mass firings asked a judge to rule that Musk's threatening email is illegal. At the same time, a federal judge blocked the DOGE team from accessing sensitive data maintained by the Education Department and the OPM. Sign up here.

REUTERS/Craig Hudson Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Summary Americans prioritize economy over Trump's Gaza plan Fighting inflation is a big motivator for 58% of survey respondents, but 32% approve of Trump's performance on prices Musk-led federal spending cuts are also important for voters, but many oppose endeavor WASHINGTON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Americans give President Donald Trump middling marks on his handling of the economy and efforts to shrink the government and are unimpressed by some of the early fights he has picked, such as proposals to take over Gaza, a Reuters/Ipsos poll shows. The poll, conducted February 13-18, asked more than 4,000 U.S. adults nationwide whether they supported a range of positions staked out by Trump and how much the issues would motivate them to vote in the future. The results point to Trump putting considerable effort into policies that many Americans don't like, or don't consider very important. A wave of frustration over prolonged inflation helped power Trump to victory in November, and a majority of respondents - 58% - said inflation would be a major factor in deciding their vote in future elections. But just 32% approved of the job Trump was doing on inflation. Views of the economy by households deteriorated this month to the lowest level in over a year, according to a widely followed survey by the University of Michigan. Just 25% of respondents - and only half of Republicans - said they supported Trump's idea of having the U.S. government take over Gaza and resettle Palestinians elsewhere. \"I thought that was a moronic idea because it's infeasible,\" said Willard Moore, a Republican lawyer in New York City who participated in the poll, referring to the Gaza proposal. \"If you did it, it would cost a lot of money, and at the end what would you have, some sort of resort? Like, what good is that for anyone?\" A notable portion of Trump's 2024 voters broke with some of the president's early actions and ideas. About a third of Trump voters opposed the proposal to end birthright citizenship and one in five opposed his administration's move to end diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Americans do consider Trump's push to downsize government important, but are divided mostly along party lines on whether they support it. Sixty percent of respondents said the so-called Department of Government Efficiency task force for cutting federal spending, which is led by Elon Musk, would influence their vote in the next federal elections in 2026, when Democrats will seek to win back control of Congress. But only 42% of the country supports the endeavor and 53% oppose it. \"He's just rushing a little bit. I think the whole thing with the DOGE is being rushed a little bit,\" said Gerald Dunn, a Republican 66-year-old martial arts instructor from Staatsburg, in New York State's Hudson Valley. \"I like what he is doing but I think a lot of what he says is just BS. When he starts talking about annexing Greenland and annexing Canada, you know that's just smoke.\" Stacked bar chart showing poll results on where American's stand on Trump's agenda broken out by political affinity EDUCATION WORRY Trump's call to abolish the Department of Education -- a move that would require Congress' support - met with broad opposition, with 65% of respondents overall and four in 10 Republicans opposed. \"I have a child who is on the spectrum, and I have the luxury to provide for her to go to school for children who have autism. If that was taken away, I wouldn’t know what I would do,\" said Mikeriah Perry, a 25-year-old from Raleigh, North Carolina, who said she leans Democratic. \"I wouldn’t have the proper resources to assist my child to be the best person they can be when it is time for them to go to the general public schools.\" Musk's stated goal of cutting costs, however, is wildly popular among Trump's hardline supporters - those in the survey who said they strongly identify with the president's Make America Great Again, or MAGA, movement. Ninety-four percent of MAGA followers back the Musk-led effort and 78% said it would be a \"very motivating\" or \"motivating\" for them in future elections. Musk's effort so far has pared hundreds of relatively small contracts it says have saved U.S. taxpayers $8.5 billion, a fraction of the annual federal budget. The same share of core MAGA voters consider increasing the deportation of illegal immigrants to be a big motivator for voting. It's an issue that was at the center of Trump's presidential campaign last year. Across all respondents in the Reuters/Ipsos poll, just over half - 55% - supported increasing deportations, compared to 41% who were opposed. But Trump's performance on immigration was approved by less than half of respondents - 47%. Trump also got mixed marks on his proposed tariffs, particularly on Canada. Fifty-nine percent of respondents, including a quarter of Republicans, rejected this idea. \"I struggle with things like picking a fight with Canada. Why are we picking a fight with Canada?\" said Todd Wellman, a 49-year-old Republican from Indianapolis, who said he wrote in now-Vice President JD Vance as his choice for president in November. Regardless of his doubts about Trump, he said he preferred him to Democratic predecessor Joe Biden and added of Trump: \"I support the direction in which he's trying to take us, but I don't always support his methods or path in getting us there.\" The poll surveyed 4,145 U.S. adults nationwide and had a margin of error of 2 percentage points.

The six-day poll, which closed on Tuesday, showed 44% of respondents approved of the job Trump is doing as president, down from 45% in a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted January 24-26. Trump's approval rating stood at 47% in a January 20-21 poll conducted in the hours after the Republican's return to the White House. The share of Americans who disapprove of his presidency has risen more substantially, to 51% in the latest poll, compared with 41% right after he took office. A line chart showing the job approval of the U.S. president Trump enjoys a relatively high rate of approval on his immigration policy, with 47% of respondents backing his approach that has included promises to ramp up deportations of migrants in the country illegally. The share was little changed from January. But the share of Americans who think the economy is on the wrong track rose to 53% in the latest poll from 43% in the January 24-26 poll. Public approval of Trump's economic stewardship fell to 39% from 43% in the prior poll. A pillar of Trump's political strength has been public belief that his policies will be good for the economy, and his rating on the economy remains significantly higher than the final readings of his predecessor in office, Democrat Joe Biden, who ended his term with a 34% approval rating on the economy. But Trump's rating for the economy is well below the 53% he had in Reuters/Ipsos polling conducted in February 2017, the first full month of his first term as U.S. president.

REUTERS/Nathan Howard/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab A line chart showing the job approval of the U.S. president In the latest poll, only 32% of respondents approved of Trump's performance on inflation, a potential early sign of disappointment in the Republican's performance on a core economic issue after several years of rising prices weakened Biden ahead of last year's presidential election. Trump defeated Biden's vice president, Kamala Harris, in the Electoral College and narrowly won the popular vote. A recent report from the U.S. Labor Department showed consumer prices rose by the most in nearly 1-1/2 years in January, with Americans facing higher costs for a range of goods and services. Other economic data has shown U.S. households expect inflation to pick up following Trump's February 1 announcements for steep tariffs on imports from China, Mexico and Canada. While the levies on Mexico and Canada were since delayed until March, Trump has set March 12 as the start date for other tariffs on imported steel and aluminum and he has directed his staff to devise global reciprocal tariffs. Tracking Trump 2.0 Presidential approval polls The state of the Trump economy Fifty-four percent of respondents in the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll said they opposed new tariffs on imported goods from other countries, while 41% were in favor of them. Increasing tariffs on Chinese goods had higher levels of support, with 49% in favor and 47% against. The Reuters/Ipsos poll , which was conducted online, surveyed 4,145 U.S. adults nationwide and had a margin of error of about 2 percentage points in either direction. Sign up here.
