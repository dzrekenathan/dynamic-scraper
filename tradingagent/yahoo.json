The tariff takes effect on March 4. Pittsburgh-based Alcoa, which produces aluminum in Canada, Iceland, Australia and elsewhere, had trimmed its output in the United States in recent years partly due to electricity costs. Reuters • 1 hour ago Canada's Scotiabank, BMO wait for clarity on tariffs to update outlook Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia and Bank of Montreal said on Tuesday they would wait for clarity on U.S. government tariffs to build more rainy-day reserves and take actions to manage risks.

The Southeast Asian nation experienced a surge in foreign investment after the first Trump administration started a trade war with Beijing in 2018, as foreign multinationals moved factories from China to its southern neighbour to avoid U.S. tariffs. Apple, chipmaker Intel and footwear and apparel giant Nike are among U.S. corporations which bet on Vietnam as a production hub for goods often exported to the United States.

While the home improvement retailer issued a cautious full-year outlook for 2025, it saw same-store sales grow by 0.8% and store foot traffic surge by 7.6% in the quarter. \"It's pretty clear, I think, from the call and from what we know about retailers in general, that companies want to sort of set a lower bar. That doesn't mean they're sandbagging it. January was a softer month than December, so they did see a little bit of a slowdown that plays into the guidance,\" D.A. Davidson managing director and senior research analyst Michael Baker tells the Catalysts team. Reacting to Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail's comments on interest rates, Baker explains to Seana Smith and Madison Mills that higher rates are \"a pressure point that's not getting any worse.\" The analyst also discusses what President Trump's tariffs could mean for Home Depot's business.

Upgrade Now What Feb. consumer confidence says about the labor market Seana Smith and Madison Mills Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 5:25 PM The preliminary Consumer Confidence Index reading shows that consumer confidence fell sharply to 98.3 in February , lower than the expected 102 and the prior reading of 104.1. The Conference Board senior US Economist Yelena Shulyatyeva joins Catalysts co-hosts Madison Mills and Seana Smith to discuss the factors driving this decline. Shulyatyeva acknowledges this was a \"sharp drop,\" with consumer confidence now at the lowest level of the range at which it has hovered for the last few years. However, she notes this number is still within a range that signals \"healthy consumer spending.\" Since this survey reflects labor market conditions, the sharp decline reveals that \"consumers are not seeing great prospects in the labor market, and that is something to watch in the months ahead.\" Shulyatyeva adds, \"If that continues to deteriorate, that's a big deal.\" She also highlights that consumers remain concerned about inflation, especially amid uncertainty around tariffs.

Upgrade Now BofA Strategist Hartnett Warns S&P 500 Rally Draws Investor Skepticism Sagarika Jaisinghani and Guy Johnson Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 12:15 PM 1 min read In This Article: ^GSPC -1.01% (Bloomberg) -- There’s growing “suspicion” among investors about the scope for more S&P 500 gains at a time when European and Chinese stocks are outperforming, according to Bank of America Corp. strategist Michael Hartnett. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump Targets $128 Billion California High-Speed Rail Project Trump Asserts Power Over NYC, Proclaims ‘Long Live the King’ NYC’s Congestion Pricing Pulls In $48.6 Million in First Month NYC to Shut Migrant Center in Former Hotel as Crisis Eases As Visitors Discover Ghent, the City Is Trying to Prevent a Tourism Takeover “The longer it takes and the harder it is for the S&P to get to new highs, the doubts grow,” Hartnett said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. “Europe’s working, China’s working, even bonds in America are starting to work.” The strategist has recommended international equities over US peers this year as he expects the so-called Magnificent Seven technology stocks to wobble after driving the US rally since the start of 2023. While he said investors are far from pessimistic about big tech, these stocks are vulnerable to declines if the trade “doesn’t keep working.” US stocks have trailed global peers this year as investors questioned lofty valuations and hefty spending on artificial intelligence. The S&P 500 is up less than 2% in 2025, while a basket of the Magnificent Seven stocks has fallen 3.3%. By contrast, the MSCI All-Country World Index excluding the US has rallied 7%. Hartnett said investors are likely to look for fiscal intervention from the Trump administration if the S&P 500 were to drop to 5,600-5,700 points — a decline of as much as 6% from current levels. “The stock market is his traffic light,” the strategist said, referring to US President Donald Trump. --With assistance from Bre Bradham.

Upgrade Now Apple plans $500 billion in US investment, 20,000 research jobs in next four years Stephen Nellis Mon, Feb 24, 2025, 12:07 PM 3 min read In This Article: AAPL +0.38% TSM -1.92% By Stephen Nellis (Reuters) -Apple said on Monday it would spend $500 billion in U.S. investments in the next four years that will include a giant factory in Texas for artificial intelligence servers and add about 20,000 research and development jobs across the country in that time. That $500 billion in expected spending includes everything from purchases from U.S. suppliers to U.S. filming of television shows and movies for its Apple TV+ service. The company declined to say how much of the figure it was already planning to spend with its U.S. supply base, which includes firms such as Corning that makes glass for iPhones in Kentucky. The move comes after media reports that Apple CEO Tim Cook met President Donald Trump last week. Many of Apple's products that are assembled in China could face 10% tariffs imposed by Trump earlier this month, though the iPhone maker had secured some waivers from China tariffs during the first Trump administration. \"This pledge represents a political gesture towards the Trump administration,\" said Gil Luria, analyst at D.A. Davidson, who estimated Apple has already committed to spend more than $150 billion per year in the United States, including cost of goods sold and capital expenditure. \"Even without growing that spend very much, they would only need 3 to 4 years to meet their obligation.\" Apple made a similar announcement about its U.S. spending plans in 2018, during the first Trump administration, when it said its new and ongoing investments would contribute $350 billion to the U.S. economy over five years. The company's shares were up 1.2%. Trump, in a Truth Social post, thanked Apple and Cook, saying the move reflected the company's faith in his administration. Most of Apple's consumer products are assembled outside the U.S., though many of Apple components are still made there, including chips from Broadcom, Skyworks Solutions and Qorvo. Apple said it last month started mass producing chips of its own design at an Arizona factory owned by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Bringing TSMC to Arizona and helping introduce legislation that later became the CHIPS Act to bolster U.S. semiconductor production were two of Trump's biggest industrial policy moves during his first term. Apple said on Monday it will work with Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, to build a 250,000-square-foot facility in Houston, where it will assemble servers that go into data centers to power Apple Intelligence, its suite of AI features that help draft emails and perform other tasks. Those servers are currently made outside of the U.S., Apple said. Story Continues Apple said it plans to increase its Advanced Manufacturing Fund from $5 billion to $10 billion, with part of the expansion being a \"multibillion-dollar commitment from Apple to produce advanced silicon\" at TSMC's Arizona factory. Apple did not disclose details of its deal with TSMC, but it has in the past used the fund to help partners build out the infrastructure needed to deliver products or services for Apple. Apple will also open a manufacturing academy in Michigan where its engineers, along with local university staff, will offer free courses for small and mid-sized manufacturing firms in areas such as project management and manufacturing process optimization.

Yahoo Personal Finance · Getty Images J Jess Ullrich Tue, Feb 18, 2025 4 min read If your personal file cabinet is overflowing with old tax records, credit card bills, or bank statements, you might be wondering what to keep and what to trash. When it comes to taxes especially, many people hesitate to toss important documents for fear of an IRS audit. It begs the question: How long should you keep tax documents? And are there any you should save indefinitely? Here’s how long to keep specific tax documents and how to properly dispose of them when the time comes. What tax documents do I need to keep? While it might be tempting to trash all your old tax forms after tax filing season, good recordkeeping is smart. You’ll want to retain the following documents for at least three years, but possibly longer — we’ll discuss specific time frames shortly. Tax returns W-2s 1099s from capital gains, dividends, self-employment earnings, or bank interest 1098s from mortgage interest deductions Additional supporting documentation for deductions and credits Supporting documentation for distributions from 529s, health savings accounts, or retirement accounts Supporting documentation for tax-deductible contributions to a retirement savings account, such as a traditional IRA Receipts for charitable donations Supporting documentation for the sale and purchase of assets in a taxable brokerage account Property tax assessments Mortgage documents, including your settlement statement Receipts for home improvements Why should I keep tax returns for three years? Under normal circumstances, the IRS recommends keeping your past tax records for three years from when you file or from the current year’s tax due date. That’s because if you're audited, you’ll typically need to provide copies of your federal tax returns from the past three tax years. This is the statute of limitations that the IRS applies in typical tax situations. But there are some exceptions to this three-year rule, especially if the IRS identifies a serious problem with your original return. In this case, the IRS can request additional tax returns. For instance, if you fail to report over 25% of your gross income on your taxes — even if it’s unintentional — the IRS can request up to six years of income tax returns. There’s no statute of limitations for taxpayers who file a fraudulent return or don’t file taxes at all. In those situations, the IRS can request as many years of tax returns as it deems necessary. The time frame for retaining state tax returns varies based on where you live. For instance, the state of California’s statute of limitations for a tax audit is four years, which means you’ll want to keep your tax returns for at least four years if you reside there.

Free tax filing: How to file your 2024 return for free Are there any tax documents I should keep longer? In addition to the uncommon tax scenarios mentioned, there are other situations when you may want to retain certain documents longer. If you file taxes in another country besides the United States, for example, you might qualify for a foreign tax credit on your U.S. returns. The IRS gives you up to 10 years to claim this credit, so you might need to keep related tax documents for up to a decade. If you’re an investor, you also have up to seven years to claim bad debt deductions for worthless securities. You might also decide to keep your W-2s indefinitely to help calculate future Social Security payments. You’ll want to keep any documents related to the purchase of your home for as long as you own it, including loan agreements and your settlement statement that itemizes your closing fees. These will be useful for calculating the taxes you’ll pay when you sell. A home sale could result in a hefty tax bill if your property has appreciated in value significantly since you bought it. The IRS looks at the difference in the initial purchase price of your home and its final sale price to help calculate your capital gains tax. But that’s not the only thing it considers; it also looks at the cost of any capital improvements you made to your home and other expenses such as any legal or recording fees you paid when you bought your property. Those amounts, minus depreciation, are your cost basis. And generally, the higher your cost basis, the lower your burden when you sell your house.

How to properly dispose of tax documents Burning and shredding are the best ways to dispose of old tax returns or other important documents. This ensures your personal and financial information remains private. Avoid putting tax returns or other personal documents in your trash or recycle bin as this could put you at risk of identity theft.

Upgrade Now Citadel Securities plots jump into crypto trading after Trump’s embrace Katherine Doherty and Sridhar Natarajan Mon, Feb 24, 2025, 5:43 PM 3 min read (Bloomberg) — Ken Griffin’s market-making giant Citadel Securities is looking to become a liquidity provider for cryptocurrencies, betting President Donald Trump’s embrace of the industry will usher in a boom for the asset class. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump Targets $128 Billion California High-Speed Rail Project Trump Asserts Power Over NYC, Proclaims ‘Long Live the King’ NYC’s Congestion Pricing Pulls In $48.6 Million in First Month NYC to Shut Migrant Center in Former Hotel as Crisis Eases As Visitors Discover Ghent, the City Is Trying to Prevent a Tourism Takeover It’s a clear pivot from the firm’s previously cautious stance on crypto market-making. Citadel Securities has had a limited presence in crypto trading, having steered clear of exchanges frequented by retail investors due to a lack of regulations around it in the US. The firm aims to get added to the roster of market makers on various exchanges, including those run by Coinbase Global Inc., Binance Holdings and Crypto.com, according to people familiar with the matter. Once the firm is approved on exchanges, it initially plans to set up market-making teams outside the US, the people said, asking not to be identified as the plans aren’t public. The extent of the push and Citadel’s desire could change based on how or if new regulations roll out in the coming months. Miami-based Citadel Securities didn’t have an immediate comment. Until now, Citadel Securities has stayed off major crypto venues frequented by retail traders. After the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX in 2022, crypto exchanges drew criticism for a failure to separate businesses — including custody, market-making and trading — that can result in conflicts of interest and in the manipulation of funds. To create some certainty and serve institutional clients, Citadel Securities teamed up with brokerage firms, including Charles Schwab and Fidelity Investments, to form an institution-only crypto exchange that mirrored the way assets are held and settled in stock and bond markets. That venue, EDX Markets, went live in 2023, and offers trading in crypto products only for institutional investors. Citadel Securities and other financial firms have been pushing for regulators to establish rules around investing in digital assets, creating a roadmap for institutions to get involved. If the US does that, the firm wants to be ready to provide liquidity, buying and selling digital assets like they do in other asset classes like equities and fixed income, the people said. ‘Crypto Capital’ The financial industry is gearing up for more activity in digital assets under the Trump administration. Story Continues As a candidate, Trump pledged to make the US the “crypto capital of the planet” and since taking power, he has sought to overhaul rules that chilled activity under President Joe Biden. Trump quickly issued an executive order on digital assets and the US Securities and Exchange Commission launched a task force on crypto headed by Hester Peirce, a longtime advocate for the industry. Citadel Securities has grown from a small group built alongside Griffin’s hedge fund into a global trading behemoth not only in US‑listed markets but also international ones, pushing into investment banks’ favored products under the leadership of Chief Executive Officer Peng Zhao. It’s a market maker in equities, options, corporate bonds, Treasuries and exchange-traded funds. But unlike its trading peers, the firm stayed away from crypto market-making. Jane Street Group, known for its dominance in markets such as ETFs and corporate bonds — which account for the majority of its business — has been executing crypto trades since 2017. Jump Crypto built out its own crypto unit to become one of the world’s top market-making firms for digital assets. But both of those firms pulled back from trading digital assets in the US amid a regulatory crackdown in 2023. A spate of crypto probes in the US prompted companies to look toward financial hubs overseas, including Dubai, Singapore and Hong Kong. Jump and Jane Street continued market making in crypto, though on a smaller scale, never abandoning the asset class entirely.

Upgrade Now US State Credit Quality Declines on ‘Destabilizing’ Trump Orders Erin Hudson Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 5:15 PM 1 min read (Bloomberg) -- The “rapid and chaotic activity” of the Trump administration is undermining the credit quality of US states, according to a new report from Municipal Market Analytics. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump Targets $128 Billion California High-Speed Rail Project Trump Asserts Power Over NYC, Proclaims ‘Long Live the King’ NYC’s Congestion Pricing Pulls In $48.6 Million in First Month NYC to Shut Migrant Center in Former Hotel as Crisis Eases As Visitors Discover Ghent, the City Is Trying to Prevent a Tourism Takeover MMA has lowered its state-sector outlook to neutral from positive, citing a bevy of White House executive orders and policies that have broad implications for federal funding and staffing. States rely on assistance from Washington for numerous programs including supporting public education and healthcare. The uncertainty created by real or threatened changes in federal funding raises the likelihood that states will tap their reserves and may cut or pause projects. That may reduce state aid to local governments, colleges or hospitals, the research firm said. States do have an “exceptional” levels of reserves, according to MMA. “The destabilizing actions of the federal government are a challenge to state credit quality,” Matt Fabian and Lisa Washburn of MMA wrote in the report. “State governments receive about one-third of their funding from the federal government and rely on such to provide essential services to their constituents.” MMA lowered its outlook for state housing finance agencies, also pointing to cuts to federal funding and staffing as increasing the risk of a negative action on the US government’s bond ratings. It also highlighted the looming threat that the administration could eliminate the muni market’s tax-exemption entirely, or in part. “States are also incurring increased costs from these actions in terms of distraction from normal government activities, increased costs for advisors and consultants to evaluate alternatives, and litigation costs related to challenging the federal government’s actions,” the researchers said.

Upgrade Now Oil Slumps to Lowest This Year as Economic Pessimism Piles Up Julia Fanzeres Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 5:16 PM 2 min read In This Article: DNKEY +3.34% DNSKF 0.00% (Bloomberg) -- Oil slumped along with equity markets as US consumer confidence tumbled, adding to mounting concerns that US President Donald Trump’s policies will hamper economic growth and sap energy demand. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump Targets $128 Billion California High-Speed Rail Project Trump Asserts Power Over NYC, Proclaims ‘Long Live the King’ NYC’s Congestion Pricing Pulls In $48.6 Million in First Month NYC to Shut Migrant Center in Former Hotel as Crisis Eases As Visitors Discover Ghent, the City Is Trying to Prevent a Tourism Takeover West Texas Intermediate fell as much as 2.6% to less than $69 a barrel, touching the lowest price this year. US consumer confidence dropped the most since 2021 and missed analysts’ estimates, prompting traders to flee risk assets, including equities. Trump’s tariffs and recent moves to further decouple economic ties with China, which spurred a drop in the Asian country’s stock markets Tuesday, are worsening the already-gloomy outlook for energy demand in the world’s largest oil consumer. Domestically, the trade turmoil is raising Americans’ inflation expectations amid a cooling labor market. “Crude markets are seeing another layer of bearish pressure from a continued string of misses in economic data,” said Frank Monkam, head of macro trading at Buffalo Bayou Commodities. “Such a rollover in economic data bodes ill for crude demand.” Crude has now broken below the roughly $5 range it had wandered in for February. Oil had initially spiked above $80 early this year before fading amid persistent expectations of lackluster Chinese demand, the potential for additional barrels on the market and the prospect that tariffs will weigh on global growth. Earlier this week, the US imposed more curbs on brokers, vessels and individuals that it said were linked to illicit shipments of Iranian crude. Markets had a muted reaction to the additional sanctions on expectations that the trade would adapt quickly by ramping up ship-to-ship transfers or switching off geo-locating signals for longer. The shifts would resemble Russia’s steps to keep crude exports flowing in the face of restrictions. “Sanctions are not the bullish factor many are expecting unless we see true attempts at locating and blockading tankers with naval forces — an unprecedented level of escalation,” said Joe DeLaura, a former trader and global energy strategist with Rabobank.

Upgrade Now Brazil Waterway Operator Extends Selloff On Drought Loss Gerson Freitas Jr. and Clarice Couto Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 5:20 PM 1 min read In This Article: AMZN -3.20% (Bloomberg) -- Hidrovias do Brasil SA, an operator of barges that transports soybeans and corn via the Amazon and its tributaries, extended a selloff to a sixth day after disclosing a loss driven by a severe drought. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump Targets $128 Billion California High-Speed Rail Project Trump Asserts Power Over NYC, Proclaims ‘Long Live the King’ NYC’s Congestion Pricing Pulls In $48.6 Million in First Month NYC to Shut Migrant Center in Former Hotel as Crisis Eases As Visitors Discover Ghent, the City Is Trying to Prevent a Tourism Takeover Shares of the Brazilian company plunged as much as 13% in Sao Paulo to the lowest level since March 2023 before trimming losses, bringing this year’s decline to nearly 30%. The grain and iron ore hauler saw fourth-quarter losses more than double from a year earlier due to a decline in transported volumes, it said in a Monday statement. Hidrovias do Brasil was one of the first companies to tap Amazon river tributaries for transportation of soybeans, opening up a new export route for Brazil’s booming harvests. It also operates in other riverways. But drier-than-normal conditions last year eroded navigation conditions, limiting its ability to move cargoes across the nation’s rivers. Sailing conditions on the Tapajos river, in the Amazon region, are expected to improve considerably in the second half of the year as local authorities are dredging the waterway, according to Chief Executive Officer Fabio Schettino. “We should not have problems anymore,” Schettino said during the call. Hidrovias do Brasil will soon announce the terms of a capital increase after scrapping a previously announced plan, the company said. The proceeds will be used to fund capacity expansion. The company’s debt has jumped to 6.6 times earnings before items such as interest and taxes, according to the statement. Its $398 million in notes due in 2031 are trading below 88 cents on the dollar.

Upgrade Now Bitcoin Slides Below $90,000 as Crypto Selloff Gathers Steam Suvashree Ghosh and David Pan Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 5:21 PM 4 min read In This Article: BTC-USD -8.04% ETH-USD -9.79% SOL-USD -6.95% (Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin tumbled below $90,000 to hit the lowest level since mid-November, as the rally that followed Donald Trump’s election to the White House reverses amid a broader retreat from risky assets. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump Targets $128 Billion California High-Speed Rail Project Trump Asserts Power Over NYC, Proclaims ‘Long Live the King’ NYC’s Congestion Pricing Pulls In $48.6 Million in First Month NYC to Shut Migrant Center in Former Hotel as Crisis Eases As Visitors Discover Ghent, the City Is Trying to Prevent a Tourism Takeover Bitcoin dropped as much as 8.5%, the biggest intraday declined since August. The largest cryptocurrency by market value was down 7.6% to $86,805 at 11:20 a.m. in New York on Tuesday. Other cryptocurrencies also fell, with Ether, XRP and Solana were mostly down more for the session. An index tracking top digital tokens was on pace for its largest four-day drop since early August. The recent turmoil in digital assets is a stark shift from the risk-on rally that drove crypto markets higher following Trump’s election in early November. Bitcoin has tumbled roughly 20% since his January inauguration, as Trump’s combative stance against allies and geopolitical rivals alike shakes investor confidence, and concerns about elevated inflation linger. “The fall in Bitcoin prices is likely related to broader macro uncertainty that has hit most financial markets in the last couple of days and is linked to the various tariffs being announced by President Trump,” said Adrian Przelozny, chief executive of crypto exchange Independent Reserve. Tumbling crypto prices mirror a broader retreat from risky assets that gained momentum late last week when a string of disappointing economic reports pushed the Nasdaq 100 to what is now its worst four-day drop since September. In turn, money has flowed into bond havens, pushing the 10-year Treasury yield down for five straight sessions. Exchange-traded fund investors, whose hand-over-fist buying helped power the post-election crypto advance, have been stepping back. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (ticker IBIT), the largest spot Bitcoin fund, shed $158 million on Monday in a rare outflow, while investors pulled nearly $250 million from the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund — the third-largest withdrawal among all ETFs. More than $956 million has exited from US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs in February, the worst month on record for the category, Bloomberg Intelligence data show. The bullish bets on crypto have seen hefty liquidations over the last two days with $815.8 million and $860 million respectively, according to data from Coinglass. Perpetual futures, which tends to be used by offshore investors due to its lack of availability in the US market, saw leveraged long positions drop. Story Continues “Perp traders showed an appetite to add BTC longs, but longs have largely been punished as BTC pushed to new yearly lows amidst substantial long liquidations,” said Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33 Research. “Aggressive positioning from offshore traders has created an environment ripe for continued volatility.” Memecoins, Giant Hack Sentiment has also soured following a series of recent industry-specific setbacks, including the biggest-ever crypto hack targeting exchange Bybit and a memecoin scandal involving Argentina’s President Javier Milei. That helps explain why digital coins have underperformed other risk assets like technology stocks in recent weeks. The Bybit hack, in particular, has added to fears about the safety of digital-asset platforms. Hackers which analysts say are linked to North Korea made off with about $1.5 billion of Ether in last week’s attack and have started quickly laundering the haul. Several researchers say the heist revealed a rising level of sophistication among North Korea’s army of hackers. Memecoins launched by Trump and his wife Melania just before the inauguration have also performed poorly, undermining confidence in his pro-crypto policies. The Trump token has tumbled more than 80% since peaking almost immediately after he launched it, based on CoinGecko data. “The Bybit hack was the latest in a string of events, such as questionable memecoin launches, that have brought back unhappy memories for crypto market participants,” said Caroline Mauron, co-founder of Orbit Markets, a provider of liquidity for crypto derivatives. Shares of crypto-related companies were also lower. Coinbase Global Inc. fell for a seventh day, and is down 29% over the period. Strategy lost around 20% over three days and is now in the red this year. Bitcoin miner MARA Holdings Inc. was down almost 10%, and is off 25% since December. --With assistance from Sidhartha Shukla, Katie Greifeld and Blaise Robinson.

Upgrade Now Exclusive-Head of Fed-watchdog task force in Congress plans broad U.S. central bank review FILE PHOTO: Federal Reserve Board Building in Washington · Reuters Howard Schneider Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 5:21 PM 2 min read By Howard Schneider WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a new congressional panel gearing up to strengthen Capitol Hill's oversight of the Federal Reserve plans a broad review of how the U.S. central bank makes its interest rate decisions, including whether controlling inflation should be prioritized over safeguarding employment. \"A substantial number of my Financial Services Committee colleagues and the chairman want to discuss that issue,\" Representative Frank Lucas, an Oklahoma Republican, told Reuters in an interview on Monday ahead of next week's first hearing of the Monetary Policy, Treasury Market Resilience, and Economic Prosperity Task Force. \"Is there really a dual mandate? And how does that affect the primary mandate of price stability?\" The Fed's dual mandate - to foster price stability and maximum employment - was imposed by Congress in 1978, and right now it is close to both goals: The unemployment rate is 4% and inflation has eased to 2.6% relative to a 2% target, a far better outcome than many feared. But the experience following the COVID-19 pandemic, with inflation surging to 40-year highs and the Fed scrambling to beat it with rapid rate hikes, has left scars. Lucas, a three-decade congressional veteran, is keen to explore whether the Fed's approach was flawed. Across a series of hearings in coming months, he will also look at longstanding issues like whether the Fed should make more use of monetary policy rules in its decisions, perhaps not to the full exclusion of its own discretion but as a way to give the public more certainty about the direction of policy. \"If your primary focus is price stability, and if you want the forces of the economy to be able to make decisions, then a more rules-focused process provides certainty to that,\" Lucas said. Lucas acknowledged the difficulty of amending the Federal Reserve Act given narrow Republican majorities in the House and Senate, and the nearly 50-year legacy of the dual mandate, but he expects his process potentially to lead to recommended legislation, a series of reports, or recommendations to the Fed. That is timely, he said, given the Fed is currently conducting its own review of an operating framework that in 2020 intensified its focus on joblessness - and which some argue slowed its response to price pressures that began building in 2021. \"These issues are relevant right now,\" he said. Along with monetary policy, the panel - composed of eight Republicans and six Democrats - will look at issues around the functioning of the U.S. Treasury market.

Upgrade Now Exclusive-Italy extends big tech tax probe to Musk's X social network Illustration shows 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and X logo · Reuters Emilio Parodi Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 5:26 PM 3 min read In This Article: META -3.13% By Emilio Parodi MILAN (Reuters) - Italy is claiming 12.5 million euros ($13 million) from Elon Musk's social network X following a tax probe running parallel to one into Meta, four sources with direct knowledge of the matter said, the latest move in a potential test case for the tech sector in Europe. While the value-added tax claim is a trifling sum for X, a company that generated $3.4 billion in revenue in 2023, the case is significant as it hinges on the way social networks provide access to their services. Italian tax authorities argue that user registrations with X, and Meta platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, could be seen as taxable transactions as they imply the exchange of a membership account in return for a user's personal data. If a judicial review upholds this interpretation, it would entail a change in the business model of the tech industry, extended to the 27-nation European Union since VAT is a harmonised EU tax. X did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The issue is particularly sensitive as U.S. President Donald Trump has raised the issue of imposing tariffs on imports from countries such as Italy that levy digital service taxes on U.S. tech companies. Musk also has a good working relationship with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and is keen to expand his Starlink communications business in the country. Italy extended its domestic tax on digital services to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in November to try to overcome U.S. objections that the levy is discriminatory. TAX AUDIT Milan's Guardia di Finanza (GDF) police closed a tax audit last April challenging X over non-payment of 12.5 million euros in VAT for the years 2016 to 2022, the four sources told Reuters. Musk completed his takeover of the formerly-named Twitter platform in October 2022. In January, Italy's Revenue Agency sent X a formal list of its own observations related only to the 2016 tax year, for which any action expires this year, fully endorsing the conclusions of the GDF investigation, the sources added. As has happened in previous such cases, Milan prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into X similar to one into Meta which completed an initial stage in December. The sources said that both Meta and X have until late March or early April to respond to the tax authority's observations, after which they will either accept its view and pay an agreed sum or initiate a fully-fledged judicial tax dispute. Italy has actively pursued tech companies over tax. Google last week agreed to pay 326 million euros to settle a tax claim relating to the period between 2015 and 2019. Story Continues Two of the sources, however, said that X and Meta were no longer interacting with the authorities because the case was not simply about agreeing a settlement figure but accepting a broader approach that would change the way business is done and how it is taxed. The two companies are awaiting a final decision by the Revenue Agency, they said. Italy's Revenue Agency, which reports directly to the Economy Ministry, will have two options if no agreement is reached: either drop its interpretation or initiate a full-blown judicial tax review. This latter procedure involves three different levels of judgment and in Italy has an average duration of about 10 years. That brings risks for the state, which could wait a decade and be left only with a handful of cash, and for companies, because from year to year the possible bill would rise if they lose.

Upgrade Now BofA CEO expects Fed to hold on rates, urges simpler regulation Saeed Azhar Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 4:37 PM 1 min read By Saeed Azhar (Reuters) - Bank of America ( BAC ) expects the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates steady this year and into next year, CEO Brian Moynihan said on Tuesday. \"It takes multiple years to squeeze inflation out,\" and the Fed's efforts to tame inflation will most likely last until 2026, Moynihan told a conference in Washington. Fed policymakers have kept rates unchanged as they seek to move inflation toward a 2% target. Moynihan also said simplifying U.S. bank regulations would be a good idea, echoing comments from other industry executives. \"Get us the rational regulatory structure and have it stick to the ribs,\" Moynihan said. \"If you keep swinging like this, our clients can't depend on us when they need us,\" Moynihan said, referring to shifting policies during successive presidential administrations. Bank of America and JPMorgan plan to lobby the White House and Congress to defend themselves from accusations by President Donald Trump and others that they have shut down conservative customers' accounts on political grounds. Trump's criticism echoed longstanding \"debanking\" complaints from Republicans, who have accused Wall Street banks of \"woke capitalism,\" as well as denying services to gunmakers, fossil-fuel companies and others perceived to be aligned with the political right. Moynihan called for more dialog about regulations on anti-money laundering, know-your-customer and reporting requirements. \"There's a lot of burden upon the banking system to both report suspicious activity and do a lot of analysis, and we have to close accounts - we can't tell people why we did,\" Moynihan said. \"It's about getting these regulations right.\" (Reporting by Saeed Azhar, editing by Lananh Nguyen and Nick Zieminski) View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard More Info Recommended Stories Copyright © 2025 Yahoo.

Upgrade Now Why stock market worries about tariff uncertainty might be a 'red herring': Morning Brief Myles Udland · Head of News Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 12:00 PM 3 min read This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings The stock market is trading near record highs, but the vibes feel off . Last week's sell-off brought out a laundry list of possible triggers, ranging from weak manufacturing data to rising inflation expectations to, of course, the impact of tariffs on consumers and across the economy. But according to Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macro, talk about the last item on that list simply covers up what the first two suggest: The US economy is slowing down. In an email on Monday, Dutta flagged four concerning developments for the economy that are largely the inverse of what led him to be among the leading voices on Wall Street arguing in favor of a \" no landing \" scenario back in 2022. The consumer is softening as income growth falls, housing is weak , government spending is slowing , and Wall Street expects the US economy to continue growing at around 2.5%, in line with each of the last three years. \"If 2023 was about being surprised to the upside, there is more risk in 2025 of being surprised to the downside,\" Dutta wrote. \"Much of what we see in the financial press — tariffs, uncertainty — is a red herring, an ex-post rationalization for an economic slowdown that was already in motion.\" Late last month, Fed Chair Jay Powell said the US economy was in \"quite a good place\" when outlining the Fed's rationale for pausing rate cuts. This assessment also helps explain why Powell seemed content not to push back on market expectations paring back their bets for further cuts. Asked about the impact of tariffs on the economy, Powell said \"significant\" shifts around tariffs, immigration policy, fiscal policy, and regulations each created \"additional uncertainty\" for the economic outlook. Still, the Fed chair appeared largely unbothered. In Dutta's view, however, the Fed's slowdown in rate cuts has created a \"passive tightening of monetary policy [that] is the dominant risk and that has important implications for financial market investors.\" In other words, by pausing rate cuts into a slowing economy, the Fed is de facto raising rates. Going forward, Dutta expects long-term rates and stocks to fall as rate cuts and an economic slowdown are priced in and the job market further slows. Whether it be tariffs, an overheated AI trade, or other pockets of froth in the stock market, the current market moment is not lacking for risks in the months ahead. Story Continues What's notable in Dutta's call is that he doesn't dredge up some obscure piece of alternative data the market hasn't yet priced in or outline an involved three-leg parlay of sentiment, valuations, and positioning. Rather, it looks at the basics: how much people get paid, how much it costs to live, and what the government is doing to help. And none of the trends are great.

Upgrade Now Home Depot posts revenue beat as home improvement challenges come into focus Brooke DiPalma · Senior Reporter Updated Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 1:03 PM 4 min read In This Article: LOW +2.05% HD +3.37% Home Depot's ( HD ) fourth quarter results slightly topped Wall Street's low expectations on Tuesday. In a slight improvement, the home improvement chain posted a 14.1% increase in revenue year over year to $39.7 billion. Adjusted earnings per share grew to $3.13, up from $2.86 last year and above estimates of $3.04. Home Depot has been struggling as shoppers held off on major renovation projects thanks to high interest rates and more cautious spending overall. That pressure is expected to continue; total net sales are expected to grow 2.8% in fiscal year 2025, while same-store sales growth is expected to increase by 1%. On the full-year outlook, CFO Richard McPhail told investors that Home Depot saw \"some benefits from hurricanes that won't fully repeat in 2025\" and that it assumes \"continued pressure on larger projects.\" Telsey Advisory Group's Joe Feldman wrote in a note to clients that the outlook was \"softer than expected,\" adding that the \"cautious approach in this uncertain environment makes sense and could prove conservative\" as consumers that have put off big projects over stubbornly higher mortgage rates , that executives say consumers will eventually \"get used to.\" Home Depot stock reversed early losses on Tuesday to gain more than 3.5% in afternoon trading.

Advanced Chart For the quarter, same-store sales growth rose 0.8%, whereas Wall Street had been looking for a drop of more than 1.71% to follow the previous eight straight quarters of negative growth. Regions affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton boosted sales growth by 60 basis points, while higher foot traffic, up 7.6%, and an uptick in the average ticket size, up 0.3%, also contributed. Feldman noted that pro categories such as roofing, drywall, and lumber also boosted results. E-commerce sales, which increased 9%, saw strength as well. The results exceeded company expectations with \"greater engagement in home improvement spend, despite ongoing pressure on large remodeling projects,\" Home Depot CEO Ted Decker said in the release.

The tariffs could increase costs, while any price hikes on retailers' end may affect consumer demand. \"We source well more than half of our goods domestically and in North America, but there certainly will be an impact,\" Decker said in the company's third quarter earnings call. This quarter, however, Decker said that the retailer is able to \"manage through any tariff environment, which would impact the industry broadly.\" He added that over the past six or seven years, Home Depot has diversified its supply chain. Correction: A previous version of this article listed the incorrect earnings figure. Home Depot's adjusted earnings per share figure was $3.13. We regret the error.

Upgrade Now Alcoa warns Trump's aluminum tariff could cost 100,000 US jobs Reuters Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 4:16 PM 2 min read (Reuters) -Aluminum producer Alcoa said on Tuesday that U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to impose a tariff on aluminum imports could cost about 100,000 U.S. jobs and would itself not be enough to entice it to boost production in the country. Trump earlier this month said he would impose a flat 25% tariff on aluminum imports \"without exceptions or exemptions\" in a bid to lift U.S. production of the metal used to make automobiles, cans and other products. The tariff takes effect on March 4. Pittsburgh-based Alcoa, which produces aluminum in Canada, Iceland, Australia and elsewhere, had trimmed its output in the United States in recent years partly due to electricity costs. Bill Oplinger, Alcoa's CEO, told the BMO Global Metals and Mining Conference in Florida that the tariffs could cost about 20,000 U.S. aluminum industry jobs and further 80,000 jobs in sectors that support it. \"This is bad for the aluminum industry in the U.S. It's bad for American workers,\" said Oplinger, an engineer by training who became CEO in 2023, in webcast remarks. U.S. data showed aluminum smelters produced just 670,000 metric tons of the metal last year, compared with 3.7 million in 2000. Plant closures in recent years, including in Kentucky and Missouri, have left the country largely reliant on imports. The tariffs alone would not be enough to entice Alcoa to restart some of its shuttered U.S. facilities, the CEO said, adding that Trump officials have asked the company to do just that. \"It's very hard to make an investment decision, even on something like a restart, without knowing how long the tariffs will last,\" Oplinger said. He also said that he has lobbied Trump officials for an exemption on Canadian aluminum imports. Alcoa would consider boosting U.S. output if it had cheap supply of power, which its Icelandic operations enjoyed, Oplinger said. Aluminum smelting consumes large amounts of electricity. Separately, Oplinger said he believed that any end to the conflict between Ukraine and Russia could see aluminum from Russia move into Europe. Oplinger also said he believed there were opportunities for the global aluminum market to consolidate, without providing details. Shares of Alcoa fell 2.6% to $34.10 in Tuesday morning trading.

Upgrade Now Nvidia, Cisco Extend Partnership Aimed at Speeding AI Adoption Ian King Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 1:40 PM 2 min read In This Article: NVDA -2.68% CSCO +1.19% (Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp., the top provider of chips used in new artificial intelligence computers, is extending a partnership with networking-gear maker Cisco Systems Inc. in a push aimed at making it easier for corporations to deploy AI systems. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump Targets $128 Billion California High-Speed Rail Project Trump Asserts Power Over NYC, Proclaims ‘Long Live the King’ NYC’s Congestion Pricing Pulls In $48.6 Million in First Month NYC to Shut Migrant Center in Former Hotel as Crisis Eases As Visitors Discover Ghent, the City Is Trying to Prevent a Tourism Takeover Many businesses remain in the early stages of adopting AI systems because of the complexity the shift adds to their data centers, Cisco and Nvidia said Tuesday in a joint statement. The two companies are broadening the list of products that include each others’ technology in an attempt to remove those hurdles. Nvidia offers networking add-ons to its AI server machinery, called Spectrum-X Ethernet. That product line will start including Cisco chips that handle broader connectivity functions, the two companies said. “Enterprises are under immense pressure to deploy AI quickly and effectively, and many leaders struggle to justify the investment while balancing the risks,” Cisco Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins said in the statement. “Together, Cisco and Nvidia are partnering to remove barriers for customers and ensure they can optimize their infrastructure investments to unlock the power of AI.” The build-out of AI data centers has been, for the most part, done by a small group of the world’s biggest companies — so-called hyperscalers like Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. that have vast engineering teams capable of designing and deploying machinery. Nvidia wants to broaden the technology’s reach beyond those few customers and push AI into the wider economy. It first teamed up with Cisco a year ago to try to reach that larger audience, including the corporations and government departments that are the networking company’s biggest users. For Cisco, which has struggled to sell its machinery into those hyperscalers’ data centers, the tie-up with Nvidia is a pathway toward grabbing a bigger slice of AI spending. Nvidia’s networking gear will include Cisco’s Silicon One chips, giving that product a boost against widely used products from Broadcom Inc.

Upgrade Now Treasury Yields Slide as Confidence Gauge Stokes Economy Fears Alice Atkins and Michael Mackenzie Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 5:15 PM 4 min read (Bloomberg) -- Treasury yields slid to their lowest levels of the year Tuesday as a gauge of consumer confidence joined a parade of evidence that US economy will require Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts this year. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump Targets $128 Billion California High-Speed Rail Project Trump Asserts Power Over NYC, Proclaims ‘Long Live the King’ NYC’s Congestion Pricing Pulls In $48.6 Million in First Month NYC to Shut Migrant Center in Former Hotel as Crisis Eases As Visitors Discover Ghent, the City Is Trying to Prevent a Tourism Takeover A bond market rally had already trimmed some Treasury yields by as much as 10 basis points before the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index fell more than expected to the lowest level since June. Yields declined to new session lows afterward, with all benchmark tenors falling at least 10 basis points. Traders resumed fully pricing in two quarter-point interest-rate cuts by the Fed this year even before the consumer confidence gauge, which is merely the latest sign that the US economy is struggling with inflation and borrowing costs. A Citigroup Inc. index of US economic surprises last week declined to the lowest level since September, indicating that data isn’t measuring up to expectations. Economic anxiety has also been stoked by declines in US stocks since the S&P 500 reached new record highs last week, with catalysts including a profit warning by Walmart Inc. Ongoing threats by US President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on imports from major trading partners and the slashing of federal payrolls are other contributors. “The 10-year will be sensitive to the data and if we do continue to see a little bit of a slowdown, then yields could grind lower,” said Gregory Faranello, head of US rates trading and strategy for AmeriVet Securities. “If the administration is going to cut spending and focus on initiatives that try and get the deficit down, then there is an element of austerity and of the economy slowing.” The 10-year has scope to reach 4.25%, its 200-day moving average, a widely followed trendline, Faranello said. A break below it “could get potentially a little grabby” as investors become concerned about missing a buying opportunity. Tuesday’s price action featured buying in 10-year Treasury options that anticipate a yield decline to around 4.15% by April 25. Bond bullishness also was reflected in JPMorgan’s weekly Treasury Client Survey, which found the biggest net long position since January. An auction of two-year notes on Monday drew strong demand despite a rally into the bidding deadline. Tuesday’s rally reduced the expected yield for new five-year notes in a $70 billion auction that closes at 1 p.m. New York time. In pre-auction trading, the notes traded at around 4.13%, down from a peak of 4.34% on the day the sale was announced last week. Story Continues Swaps that predict the outcome of future Fed rate decisions are pricing in 53 basis points of easing by the end of the year, up from 48 basis points on Monday. “Red flags are emerging for the US economy,” said Elias Haddad, senior market strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. “Another month or two of poor US economic data would deliver a blow to the US exceptionalism narrative.” What Bloomberg strategists say... “The narrative shifted on Monday, from ‘the new US administration isn’t yet delivering on our pro-growth expectations’ to ‘US policies may be starting to cause real economic damage.’ ... That’s why US 10-year yields are at their lowest level in more than two months and likely to head a chunk lower again over the coming weeks.” — Mark Cudmore, MLIV Executive Editor, Singapore. Read more here. The bond rally has driven 10-year yields to within 2 basis points of three-month bill yields, threatening to invert that part of the yield curve for the first time since mid-December. Historically, inversions have been a precursor of economic recessions, though the most recent period of inversion since late 2022 has not thus far. Bond traders also are contending with uncertainty about the Treasury supply outlook, which rests in part on Fed balance-sheet policy. The US central bank has been winding down its Treasury holdings, and traders have been anticipating it’s preparing to pause or slow down that process as the balance sheet approaches a certain size. Federal debt-ceiling considerations could influence the decision, the minutes of last month’s Fed policy meeting indicated. Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, speaking on that topic in London Tuesday, said it would be appropriate in the medium term for the Fed to purchase more shorter-term securities than longer-term ones so that its portfolio can more quickly mirror the composition of Treasury issuance, without commenting on the timing of any policy change. --With assistance from Ye Xie.

Upgrade Now Unforgiving math has Republicans asking for 'prayer' as they try to move forward on tax cuts Ben Werschkul · Washington Correspondent Updated Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 4:19 PM 6 min read House Republicans are trying to keep Donald Trump's push for \"one big beautiful bill\" alive this week with a budget resolution that will set the parameters of any deal. The challenge is making space for even a sliver of Trump's 17 different tax cut ideas. House Speaker Mike Johnson is facing microscopic margins, caught between deficit hawks on one side and nervous GOP moderates on the other. Both camps seemingly are ready to tank the effort even before it gets fully underway. \"This is a prayer request,\" Johnson even quipped on Monday. \"Just pray this through for us because it is very high stakes,\" he added of this week's effort even as he expressed confidence Republicans could get it done. \"I don't think anyone wants to be in front of this train. I think they want to be on it,\" he added. Underlying the problem for Johnson and his party is the unforgiving math — especially on the tax side of things — that has its roots in an array of promises from a freewheeling Trump. Yahoo Finance counted more than a dozen tax pledges from Trump before last November's election. A recounting in recent days has upped the tally to 17 different ideas, almost all of them cuts. Even the smallest estimates of Trump's varied tax promises put the tab at about $10 billion. The higher-side projections amount to much more: almost $18 trillion in new red ink over the coming decade. Meanwhile, Johnson and his colleagues are putting aside space for, at most, $4.5 trillion for tax cuts as part of an overall bill that would be paired with about $1.5 trillion in spending cuts. In addition to being nowhere close to enough to pay for Trump's tax ideas, the proposed cuts are also proving unpopular in their own right, as is the idea of potentially $3 billion in new red ink. \"The big question for me is whether the markets balk at that or not,\" Pangea Policy founder Terry Haines said in a recent episode of Yahoo Finance's Capitol Gains podcast of new deficit spending, adding, \"Once the degree of deficit increase becomes clear ... the markets are going to have a question to answer about whether they want to support this or not.\" Johnson is also already facing two public GOP \"no\" votes — Reps. Tim Burchett and Victoria Spartz, who say spending cuts need to be deeper. But other Republicans are making noise about joining them and voting no for the opposite reason, saying some of the harsher cuts — especially in healthcare — might need to be reversed. Democrats appear set to vote no en masse, calling the entire project a giveaway to the rich. Story Continues A tax plan left squeezed The math has left House Republicans with an allotment for tax cuts that may not even be enough to cross off the first item on Trump's list: extending the expiring provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. An analysis from the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) found that paying for that item alone could cost between $3.9 trillion and $4.8 trillion over the next decade. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt recently outlined Trump's eight top tax priorities. They included extending that 2017 law, providing relief on state and local taxes (SALT), no taxes on tips or overtime pay or Social Security benefits, cuts in the corporate tax rate for domestic production, closing the so-called carried interest loophole , and reducing tax benefits for sports stadium owners. The total tab for those ideas — even with the last two items on Trump's list representing tax increases — comes to somewhere between $5 trillion and $11.2 trillion, according to the CRFB . Speaker of the House Mike Johnson speaks with reporters at the US Capitol on Feb. 24. (Kent Nishimura/Getty Images) · Kent Nishimura via Getty Images And that's without a host of other ideas that Trump expounded on the campaign trail but has downplayed more recently. Such ideas — many of which remain popular in powerful corners of Capitol Hill — range from making car loan interest fully deductible to a new tax credit for family caregivers to a further expansion of the child tax credit. The total tab is somewhere between $10-18 trillion in impact to the federal budget over the coming decade, according to estimates from both the CRFB and from the Yale Budget lab. That means hard decisions — or some seriously fuzzy math — is in the offing as Republicans search for a way to fulfill perhaps their central 2024 promise in a world of $36 trillion national debt. 'We're about to enter a period of substantially more uncertainty' But even the initial efforts to pay for it have left some moderate Republicans wary. The budget blueprint set to be voted on this week has signaled that Medicaid could be in for $880 billion in cuts to the government healthcare program for low-income individuals and families. That puts at risk a program that is heavily relied on by voters, even in Republican districts. It's why Johnson and other Republican leaders are currently at risk of losing the vote of moderate figures such as Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey , among others. An analysis from the left-leaning Center for American Progress found that Drew's district alone could lose up to $2.18 billion in Medicaid funding if the cuts go through, potentially jeopardizing healthcare for 50,000 of his voters. President Donald Trump listens to a question during a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House in Washington on Feb. 24. (LUDOVIC MARIN/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) · LUDOVIC MARIN via Getty Images Republicans also face a political imperative to find a path to some sort of deal after making tax cuts a signature 2024 campaign issue and major provisions of the 2017 law set to expire at the end of the year in what Republicans like to call potentially the biggest tax increase in history if no action is taken. Haines currently pegs the odds of some sort of tax deal this year at 80% and predicts that ideas like no tax on tips (\"the oldest ask from Trump\") and increasing the SALT cap must be included in the bill because of their fierce political support. The bill is \"moving about as quickly as Washington can move,\" he said, noting that it could be a bumpy ride for markets in the short term, saying, \"We're about to enter a period of substantially more uncertainty.\" Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.

Upgrade Now Consumer confidence plunges most in nearly 4 years as inflation fears escalate on Trump tariff threats Alexandra Canal · Senior Reporter Updated Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 5:08 PM 3 min read In This Article: ^DJI -0.18% ^GSPC -0.97% ^IXIC -1.78% Consumer confidence declined sharply in February, notching its biggest monthly decline in nearly four years as uncertainty related to Trump's trade policy also lifted inflation expectations, according to new data released Tuesday morning . The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for February came in at a reading of 98.3, a significant drop from January's revised 105 reading and short of the 102.5 reading expected by economists. Read more: From $5 eggs to insurance premiums, here's where prices are rising “In February, consumer confidence registered the largest monthly decline since August 2021,” Stephanie Guichard, senior economist at the Conference Board, said in a press release. “This is the third consecutive month-on-month decline, bringing the Index to the bottom of the range that has prevailed since 2022.\" The \"Present Situation Index,\" which measures consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, fell to 136.5 in February from 139 in January. The \"Expectations Index,\" which tracks consumers' short-term outlook for income, business, and labor market conditions, also fell to 72.9 in February from 82 last month. Historically, a reading below 80 in that category signals a recession in the coming year. This was the first time since June 2024 that the index came in below that threshold. Meanwhile, average 12-month inflation expectations jumped from 5.2% last month to 6% in February, echoing other recent data points that highlight greater concerns around tariff uncertainty and the impact those policies could have on inflation. \"This increase likely reflected a mix of factors, including sticky inflation but also the recent jump in prices of key household staples like eggs and the expected impact of tariffs,\" Guichard said. \"There was a sharp increase in the mentions of trade and tariffs, back to a level unseen since 2019. Most notably, comments on the current Administration and its policies dominated the responses.\" President Donald Trump departs after speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference, CPAC, at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center, Saturday, Feb. 22, 2025, in Oxon Hill, Md. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) · ASSOCIATED PRESS President Donald Trump's revived tariff threats have weighed on sentiment as the administration doubles down on 25% across-the-board tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which are set to come next month. 10% duties on China have already been implemented. Earlier in February, Trump announced global 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports that are expected to take effect on March 12. Trump later ordered that federal agencies study reciprocal tariffs on trading partners. More recently, Trump said to expect additional duties on autos , chips, and pharmaceuticals. A flat tariff \"in the neighborhood of 25%\" would apply to all foreign automakers and start as soon as April 2. Story Continues \"Everybody is talking about inflation rising on the back of tariffs and that is a great concern for the consumer,\" Yelena Shulyatyeva, senior US economist at the Conference Board, told Yahoo Finance in an interview following the data's release. Notably, February's decline was broad-based among income groups, including the more affluent cohort of consumers, which has driven the bulk of spending in recent years. \"That is a concern,\" Shulyatyeva said. \"We know that consumer spending has been in large part driven by those at the top of the income spectrum. ... If this is going to slow down significantly, that's a concern for the economy.\" Eugenio Aleman, chief economist at Raymond James, wrote it's still \"up in the air\" whether or not this lack of confidence will translate to weaker economic growth.

AI spend key areas for Q4 results Nvidia's (NVDA) upcoming fourth quarter results — due out next Friday, February 28 — are expected to be pivotal, as the company begins shipping its new Blackwell AIchips. Francisco Bido, senior portfolio manager at FM Investments, joins Catalysts to point out that the demand for the new Blackwell chips will be a critical indicator of Nvidia's performance. \"I'll be paying lots of attention to the demand for the new Blackwell chips. That's one thing. And, I'm also interested in seeing if they're willing to discuss how foreign governments and US government is going to increase their spending in AI if they have any hints where that's going,\" Bido says. Regarding the development of Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) platform DeepSeek, Bido believes it will benefit the AI industry by expanding its user base. \"DeepSeek is basically a good thing for the AI industry. It's a way of making it widely available to many other potential users, and, if anything, it just widens the ecosystem and accelerates the early adoption of AI,\" he says. On market volatility, Bido anticipates disruption from uncertainty around tariffs. \"It's not so much whether they get implemented or not. It's just the threat of having them... that forces the people on the other side or the countries on the other side to think about diversification regardless if they're getting implemented or not,\" Bido explains.

To discuss what options markets are predicting ahead of the tech giant's results, BayCrest managing director of equity derivatives David Boole joins Morning Brief. According to Boole, options markets anticipate approximately 7% stock price volatility following the announcement — a moderate projection compared to recent quarters. This suggests that Nvidia's quarterly results report, while still significant, matters \"a little bit less than it used to,\" Boole explains. Though a 7% movement would translate to roughly $240 billion in market capitalization fluctuation, Boole points out this is only 2.5 times Nvidia's typical daily volatility. \"It's a big event, but I'm starting to think that it might not be a one-day surge like it used to,\" he tells Yahoo Finance, while acknowledging the results will likely \"set the stage\" for the stock's trajectory in the following month.

Simply put, an option is a contract between a buyer and a seller. “The buyer is paying a premium for the rights to execute upon that contract. The seller receives that premium,’ explains Inskip. Blikre and Inskip break down the key components of an option into four parts: quantity—one contract typically represents 100 shares; product—the security being traded; strike price—the agreed-upon price; and timeframe—the expiration date. When considering calls and puts, it’s important to remember, “Anytime you hear the word long, just like with stock, we think purchased. Short, we think sold. Call, the right to buy. Put, the right to sell,” says Inskip.

So this stock can go to zero overnight, but all they're [going to] lose is the premium they paid for that call.” The video also shares McLaughlin’s common strategies and tips for managing volatility in the options market.

Crossmark Global Investments chief market strategist Victoria Fernandez joins Morning Brief with Seana Smith and Brad Smith to discuss why the current market requires investors to be careful in deciding where to put their money. The strategist says the market's resiliency despite looming uncertainties is \"justified to an extent\" as \"there's probably a little bit more room to go here.\" She explains, \"We know 70% of our economy is driven by the consumer, and the consumer continues to spend. We've seen that in the consumption numbers.\" \"Is there a little bit more room to run here because earnings are still supportive? Yes. But are we seeing things telling us the economy is going to slow down? Yes, we are seeing that as well. So I think you do have to be cautious in where you put your money to work,\" Fernandez adds. She notes that Walmart's (WMT) earnings report, which sent the stock lower on a weaker-than-expected outlook, demonstrates this sentiment. \"There's going to be sectors that continue to do well and have support ... [but] we have to wonder if the earnings we've been seeing this quarter are pulled ahead because of tariffs and other elements that people anticipate over the coming quarters.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.

Chen identifies Walmart as a retail sector leader, noting the company \"executes so well\" across supply chain, curbside pickup, delivery, and AI implementation. \"It's really hard for everybody to do this\" at Walmart's scale and efficiency, Chen says. \"This company is consistent, and the consumer is consistent, so it's [Walmart] well positioned for a beat-and-raise,\" he explains. On investment potential, Chen affirms that \"we certainly like it for the longer term.\" He elaborates: \"What we are thinking is that there's a real barbell opportunity, meaning... these retailers that can execute to exceptional value, low prices, rollbacks, they will be better positioned because customers will trade down to places like Walmart to get that everyday low price. And that's great across all cohorts.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief&nbsp;here.

Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi chats with Bausch + Lomb chairman and CEO Brent Saunders. Saunders is known as one of the biggest dealmakers in the pharmaceutical industry of the past 15 years. Saunders returned to Bausch + Lomb as CEO in March 2023. In May 2013, he was also the CEO of Bausch + Lomb, responsible for its $8.7 billion sale to Valeant Pharmaceuticals. He then took over as the CEO of Forest Laboratories. By February 2014, Saunders orchestrated a sale of the company to Actavis for $25 billion. He assumed the CEO position. From there in November 2014, he pulled off a $70 billion acquisition of Allergan and became its CEO. It's there where Saunders' star quickly rose in media circles, overseeing the commercial success of botox and doing battle with feared activist investor Carl Icahn. Saunders then sold Allergan to Abbvie (ABBV) for $63 billion in a deal that closed in May 2020. He says no deal is imminent for Bausch + Lombb.

The iPhone developer is reportedly partnering with Alibaba (BABA) to further expands its artificial intelligence (AI) strategy, according to a report by The Information. TECHnalysis Research president Bob O'Donnell discusses on Asking for a Trend how the iPhone SE, with its smaller form factor and lower price, appeals to customers who prefer compact devices. \"The [iPhone] SE has never been a huge part of the iPhone market in terms of a percentage, but there is a very distinct group of people who just don't really like huge phones. And, the SE has served that market,\" O'Donnell says. While the SE may not drive massive sales, it serves a niche market, particularly in emerging regions where its affordability is key. O'Donnell comments on Apple's new AI partnership with Alibaba as the tech giant seeks to further penetrate China's consumer tech market: \"This is something that we knew had to be coming, not necessarily with Alibaba. But in order for Apple to bring Apple intelligence to China they were going to have to find a Chinese partner, and it's well known that Chinese consumers are very interested in AI capabilities.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trend&nbsp;here.

As Trump and his team work to establish new tariffs against foreign nations like Canada, China, and Mexico, everything is different from his first administration. On this week’s episode of Capitol Gains, Washington Correspondent Ben Werschkul breaks down the three main reasons why Trump’s latest tariffs are different from when he was in office during his first term. Werschkul attributes the differences to three main things: Trump is different The world is different Americans are different With Trump, he’s changed his approach to tariffs from his first administration. During Trump’s first term, tariffs were more focused on specific duties. This time around tariffs are bigger and blanketed, as we are seeing with his 10% tariffs on all imported goods from China. Werschkul says the tariffs are different because the world is different due to foreign nations learning Trump’s playbook during his first term. “They had years to plan for their retaliations,” Werschkul explains. We saw a lot of really novel approaches to response here that I think will change the back and forth [negotiations] here.” The third change to tariffs are the American people. American consumers are focused in on prices right now. “Inflation wasn’t at the top of mind six years ago,” Werschkul says. “Any changes we see here in prices are going to be noted on by Americans, which the White House will be watching for certain.” To learn more, listen to the full episode of Capitol Gains here.

Yahoo Finance Video • 21 days ago NVDA MSFT MicroStrategy history: Beyond the Ticker MicroStrategy (MSTR) and its chairman, Michael Saylor, are practically synonymous with bitcoin (BTC-USD) these days, but the business intelligence company has been around since 1989. Beyond the Ticker takes a deep dive into the company’s biggest moments. 1989 Back then, it was all about data analytics, and Saylor – fresh out of MIT – was a rising tech star. 1998 With the dot-com boom well underway, MicroStrategy went public under the familiar MSTR ticker at $12 per share. It rocketed to $333 as the dot-com boom peaked. Saylor became a paper billionaire practically overnight and wasn’t afraid to spend his wealth on legendary parties and a yacht, capturing the flashy spirit of the era. 2000 But when the dot-com bubble burst, MicroStrategy’s stock plummeted to just 42 cents, a stunning 99.9% drop. The company had to restate its financials, and the SEC slapped the company with fines. Still, Saylor held on, shifting MicroStrategy’s focus back to enterprise software and slowly dug the company out of its hole. 2010 MicroStrategy was moving into mobile analytics, and Saylor wrote a prescient book about the coming smartphone revolution called, “The Mobile Wave.” 2014 Facing stiff competition, MicroStrategy laid off more than 700 workers, and Saylor cut his own salary to just one dollar. 2020 The pandemic, however, would bring new opportunities. Saylor pivoted MicroStrategy again – this time into bitcoin – arguing that it was a better store of value than cash. 2024 He poured billions of corporate dollars into it. And today, MicroStrategy holds around 439,000 bitcoin with an average purchase price just over $60,000. With bitcoin trading around $100,000 per coin, MicroStrategy’s crypto stash is worth $44 billion. Investors, however, are placing a significant premium on the company, pushing its market capitalization to $89 billion – enough to secure its admission to the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) on December 23, replacing Super Micro Computer (SMCI.NE).

Filmore describes it as \"a milestone to see these two products at such large AUM [assets under management] levels,\" emphasizing that SPY \"arguably has the best liquidity in the market\" and is more suitable for active traders. He points out that VOO's lower fees make it potentially more attractive for long-term investors: \"So if you're a buy-and-hold investor, VOO might be more favorable.\" However, Filmore maintains that both products are \"very healthy.\" Addressing YouTuber Kevin Paffrath's recent closure of his ETF (PP), which held approximately $32 million in assets, Filmore acknowledges that \"it was a good example of innovation in the market,\" though he emphasizes that \"it comes down to education\" for investors considering these types of investment vehicles.

Amid the media giant's shift from linear networks to streaming, Johnston notes, \"The linear networks in streaming are in many ways two sides of a coin because a lot of the content that we produce actually winds up in both locations. So, in many ways, we've kind of perfectly hedged the business.\" \"So much of what we do is integrated in so many ways,\" the CFO explains. \"Given we have almost 180 million subscribers, we've really achieved a level where the streaming business is a terrific business unto itself, and because of the integration with linear, I think we can make it better than what other people can because we can produce content that cuts across both distribution channels.\" Netflix (NFLX) has staked its claim as an early streaming giant. The company reported better-than-expected results and raised its 2025 outlook. Johnston says, \"Netflix obviously had a big quarter in terms of content, both with some of the sports activities and some distribution deals they had done outside the US, but from our perspective, we're managing the business in a way where we're trying to grow subs, and we're trying to improve margins at the same time, and we're very much on track — in fact, if anything, slightly ahead — in terms of achieving both of those goals.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more \"Morning Brief\" here.

The startup claims to offer a more cost-effective alternative to established chatbots from Silicon Valley's tech giants. Director of Cornell University's Tech Policy Institute, Sarah Kreps, joins Catalysts to share her thoughts on this new technology. Kreps contextualizes DeepSeek's emergence against recent major AI announcements, including the Trump administration's $500 billion Stargate AI initiative and Meta Platforms's (META) $65 billion AI commitment. \"It was so interesting to follow that, at a 5% or a fraction of what these Big Tech companies are spending, it looks like this small Chinese startup is able to perform in many of the same ways as these American pioneers,\" she tells Yahoo Finance. According to Kreps, DeepSeek places \"enormous pressure\" on US AI companies to showcase tangible value from their investments. She expects \"ripple effects,\" as this development will challenge companies to \"raise the bar\" for AI technology. Looking ahead, Kreps predicts \"a bifurcation within the market,\" noting that \"not every company can afford OpenAI's services; they might prefer these alternatives that are a fraction of the price.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts&nbsp;here.

This announcement triggered a notable sell-off among major tech stocks. Futurum Group CEO Dan Newman and Bernstein managing director and senior analyst Stacy Rasgon share their insights on Morning Brief. Rasgon feels minimally concerned about the situation. He notes, \"The models they've built are fantastic, they really are ... but what they're doing is not miraculous either or unknown to any of the other top-tier AI researchers or AI labs that are out there.\" While recognizing the market's \"panic,\" Rasgon characterizes the stock decline as \"overblown,\" stating, \"I don't think DeepSeek is doomsday for AI infrastructure.\" Newman echoes Rasgon's skepticism, raising questions about the announcement's credibility. \"When did we decide that we're going to just believe a paper that comes out of China?\" he says. Newman suggests the claims require verification, noting that \"it's not unlike China to potentially try and play a little bit of psyops with Americans and the markets to see how we would react.\" However, Newman also acknowledges that if DeepSeek's claims are \"accurate,\" affordable AI models could benefit the entire sector. \"I just think the market's completely missing this one, and the fact that we're believing China just with their word, to me, I think that needs a little more inspection,\" he adds.

Sankey Research lead analyst Paul Sankey sits down with Madison Mills and Seana Smith on Catalysts to examine the energy sector as investors try to gauge the impact of Trump 2.0. \"It's definitely disconcerting that [the Trump administration keeps] talking about lower oil prices,\" Sankey says. He notes there's a \"directly opposing internal inconsistency\" within Trump's rhetoric on energy. Sankey explains, \"There's a very specific concern about pump gasoline prices, and then at the same time, you've got things like the tariff threat from Canada ... our biggest oil supplier, oil that we also can't replace.\" He adds, \"They want lower prices, but a lot of what they're saying and doing would mean higher prices.\" Looking ahead, the analyst notes that natural gas is positioned well for success given the amount of spending going into artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure which \"obviously, is going to need an absolutely enormous amount of US electricity, and that becomes US natural gas.\" There is growing uncertainty about President Trump's future tariff policy, as the president has seemingly backed away from his harsh pre-inauguration tariff rhetoric.

Elizabeth O’Brien, Vice President of the US Chamber Foundation’s Hiring Our Heroes program, dissects the many causes and effects of the issue on a new episode of Yahoo Finance’s Warrior Money podcast, co-hosted by Patrick Murphy and Dan Kunze. As Kunze notes during their conversation, it’s often said that it takes two years for an individual to feel at home in a new place. When a military spouse is forced to move every few years, that process can become an unending cycle. “The sooner we can build networks and social capital for military families as they move to new communities, the better,” O’Brien says. “We have the same challenges that so many of our American families have: access to safe, affordable childcare; re-entry to the workforce. Our challenges aren’t unique only to us,” she explains. “But there are solutions that we can create for our military families that then benefit America writ large.” One’s ability to serve in the military is often dependent upon the financial stability of their household. When military spouses cannot find employment, the armed forces themselves may see a lower turnout. Thus, the economic well-being of military spouses can have a ripple effect on the rest of the country, such as “keeping our infrastructure sound, keeping us competitive on the global economy, and impacts to national security,” O’Brien explains. “If I didn’t have the opportunity to go to work, [my husband] wouldn’t be a colonel in the Army right now,” she adds. O’Brien discusses what solutions are available to military spouses and what more needs to be done in her full conversation with Murphy and Kunze. Hosted by former Congressman Patrick Murphy and veteran investor Dan Kunze, Yahoo Finance’s&nbsp;Warrior Money&nbsp;is a weekly vodcast dedicated to uplifting military veterans transitioning into civilian life. Through insights from fellow veterans and high-ranking government officials, Murphy and Kunze are helping set vets up for success through financial education and inspiration.

Daily 9:00AM - 10:00AM ET Featured Krispy Kreme aims for long-term growth through US partners: CEO Krispy Kreme's (DNUT) recent struggles were evident as the company missed Wall Street expectations in its fourth quarter, with a 10% drop in revenue from last year. Krispy Kreme stock plunges by over 20% Tuesday morning as it also issued weaker-than-expected guidance. Krispy Kreme CEO Josh Charlesworth joins Morning Brief to discuss the company's strategy moving forward with Seana Smith, Brad Smith, and Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Brooke DiPalma. “This morning, we did report our 18th consecutive organic growth quarter... that was actually in line with our expectations, excluding the very disruptive cyber incident we had last year,\" Charlesworth says, referencing a cyberattack that targeted the chain in November 2024 and impacted online ordering. He emphasizes the company's efforts to transform Krispy Kreme into a larger, more successful brand. \"Our core strategy is working, which is to get those awesome, fresh donuts out to more people. And, we really focused on the milestones we achieved in 2024 and 2025 to do that in the US through national distribution partners and internationally with franchise partners,\" the CEO adds, voicing an aim for sustainable, long-term expansion.

The Conference Board senior US Economist Yelena Shulyatyeva joins Catalysts co-hosts Madison Mills&nbsp;and Seana Smith to discuss the factors driving this decline. Shulyatyeva acknowledges this was a \"sharp drop,\" with consumer confidence now at the lowest level of the range at which it has hovered for the last few years. However, she notes this number is still within a range that signals \"healthy consumer spending.\" Since this survey reflects labor market conditions, the sharp decline reveals that \"consumers are not seeing great prospects in the labor market, and that is something to watch in the months ahead.\" Shulyatyeva adds, \"If that continues to deteriorate, that's a big deal.\" She also highlights that consumers remain concerned about inflation, especially amid uncertainty around tariffs. With inflation remaining sticky and tariffs potentially proving inflationary, she notes this combination presents \"a big concern for the consumer.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts&nbsp;here.

The amount you pay as a down payment can influence your mortgage interest rate. Generally, larger down payments result in lower interest rates, as lenders see these as a sign of strong financial commitment. Loan term Loan Term: This refers to the duration over which you will repay your loan, typically measured in years. Opting for a longer loan term can reduce your monthly payments by spreading them out over a greater number of years, whereas shorter loan terms generally lead to higher monthly payments. 30-year fixed 30-year fixed 15-year fixed 5-year ARM Interest rate Interest Rate: This is the annual cost you incur for borrowing money, expressed as a percentage of the loan amount. It represents the fee you pay each year to the lender for your loan. Data is provided as-is via the Zillow Mortgage API © Zillow, Inc., 2024. Use is subject to the Zillow Terms of Use.

The purchase price of the house, the down payment, the monthly payment — all big numbers. A mortgage calculator helps you make sense of what can be abstract. Using it allows you to consider all the factors that can impact home affordability, quality of life, and wealth accumulation. Not to mention helping you achieve peace of mind with what might be a bit mind-boggling. Here's how to think through the calculations step by step. Learn more: Everything you should know as a first-time home buyer How to use the Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator Just four data points will get you started: Home price Easy enough, this is the price you'll pay for the home you're considering. When it comes time to make the deal, the price may be a point of negotiation. Here, you can start with a price that buys you all the amenities you could possibly want — and then work down from there to achieve a real-life monthly payment you can afford.

How much is the monthly payment on a $300,000 mortgage? What is the monthly payment on a $200,000 mortgage? Down payment The down payment is another number that might begin as a moving target. You might put in a number that's the bare minimum, say a 3% down payment, and then work your way up from there. If you are a military-connected borrower using a no-down-payment-required VA loan or a low-income buyer in a rural area eligible for a USDA loan, you may even have earned the right to put a zero here. Learn more: How much down payment do you need for a house? Loan term A loan term is the number of years you expect to pay off the loan. You'll see that a 30-year fixed-rate loan is the default here. Don't let that stop you from investigating the monthly payment of a 15-year loan or one with an even shorter term. Quicker paybacks result in paying less interest and gaining value, or equity , in your home faster. Learn more: 15-year vs. 30-year mortgage — Which is better? Interest rate You can take a look at the lender offers above to fine-tune your mortgage interest rate, but for now, put in a rate that you believe you'll qualify for. It's a good idea to resist the temptation to be overly optimistic here. It feels much better to qualify for a lower mortgage rate than you expected rather than the other way around. Dig deeper: How to get the lowest mortgage rate possible What is included in a typical mortgage payment Now that you've filled in the basics, the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator reveals your estimated monthly payment with principal and interest estimates built in. Here are typical costs often included in your monthly mortgage payment. Mortgage principal : The amount you owe on the loan. This is estimated for you. Mortgage interest : The interest you pay to borrow the money. This is included with the principal estimate. Homeowners insurance : An estimated monthly cost for the insurance premium you'll pay to protect your home in case of damage. Property taxes : The taxes you'll pay on your home and land. This is not estimated, but you can click on the dropdown link to add it to your estimated payment if you have an idea of how much it costs. Private mortgage insurance : If you put down less than 20% on a conventional loan, the lender will charge you PMI. You can put an estimate of that in the dropdown as well. HOA fees : Some neighborhoods charge homeowners' association fees to pay for maintenance and improvements on shared spaces. You can add that to your monthly payment calculation. Tip: Other costs of homeownership are not built into the loan payment, including: utilities, maintenance, repairs, and upgrades. Read more: PITI (principal, interest, taxes, insurance) and how it affects your mortgage payment The monthly payment breakdown In the middle of the payment calculator is a pie chart showing a graphic breakdown of the main components of your monthly payment: principal and interest in blue, a property tax estimate in yellow, and the estimated homeowners' monthly insurance premium in teal. Learn more: How much house can I afford? Use Yahoo Finance's home affordability calculator. The mortgage payment formula The Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator does the work for you, but for those who wish to look under the hood, here is the actual calculation: Mortgage payment formula · Brent Sanchez A is the monthly mortgage payment (in dollars) P is the principal amount of the loan (the amount you borrow) r is the monthly interest rate (as a decimal) n is the total number of payments over the life of the loan Here's how to use the formula: Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly interest rate: Divide the annual interest rate by 12. For example, if your annual interest rate is 5%, your monthly interest rate would be 0.05 / 12 = 0.004167. Calculate the total number of payments: Multiply the number of years in your loan term by 12 (i.e. 12 months of the year). For example, a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage would have 30 years x 12 months = 360 payments. Put the values into the formula: Once you have the monthly interest rate and the total number of payments, you can plug them in along with the home loan amount (P) into the formula to calculate the estimated monthly mortgage payment. Remember, this is an estimate from a manual calculation. The actual payment may vary depending on factors such as private mortgage insurance and property taxes, which are included in the Yahoo Finance calculator but are still only estimates. Learn more: What is mortgage insurance, and how much does it cost? Why use a mortgage calculator? Taking a mortgage payment calculator for a spin can be an interesting exercise. But there are some serious decisions it can help guide, as well. For example: To determine the mortgage that's best for you When shopping for a mortgage loan, you can compare the interest rates offered by different mortgage lenders by entering them into the calculator and seeing how a slight improvement in your rate can impact your monthly payment. Perhaps more importantly, you can get a feel for just how much interest you'll save over the life of a home loan. Read more: Best mortgage lenders for first-time buyers To consider different loan terms A 30-year mortgage loan has traditionally been the standard loan term, but many other options exist. A shorter term will pay off the loan faster and set you on the path to greater wealth accumulation. That's important if you want to shorten the runway to your life after work. You can also compare a fixed-interest-loan rate with an ARM's introductory rate. Adjustable-rate mortgages can be appropriate for home buyers who expect to move before the five- or 10-year introductory rate period ends. Learn more: Adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgage To evaluate your down payment A mortgage calculator can also provide a real-life comparison of how important a down payment can be in lowering your monthly payment. Or in deciding just how little you can put down and still afford the payment.

How to lower your monthly payment Finally, a mortgage calculator can help you know where your sweet spot of affordability is. If the estimated payment is too high, you can consider these strategies to lower it: Buy less house . It sounds simple, but it may not be easy to adjust your expectations at first. Start looking at smaller homes or longer commutes. You may find the perfect — and more affordable — house. Make a larger down payment. (You'll also avoid paying PMI.) Qualify for a lower interest rate. Extend the loan term. Learn more: How a 40-year mortgage works Mortgage calculator FAQs What mortgage can I afford with a $70,000 salary? A $70,000 salary could help you comfortably afford a home of roughly $210,000. However, the exact number will depend on your mortgage rate, down payment amount, and whether you have other monthly debt payments. How much income do you need for a $400,000 mortgage? You would need roughly a $100,000 salary (probably a little more) to afford monthly payments on a $400,000 mortgage. This means a gross monthly income of at least $8,334. How much income do you need for a $500,000 mortgage? The recommended income for a $500,000 mortgage is at least $125,000, or $10,417 per month before taxes.

Read our full review of Capital One What is a high-yield savings account? A high-yield savings account (HYSA) is a type of deposit account offered by brick-and-mortar banks, online banks, neobanks, and credit unions. As with traditional savings accounts, high-yield savings accounts typically don’t offer debit cards or check-writing privileges; you may be able to transfer money between your HYSA and other accounts via online transfers. An HYSA functions similarly to a traditional savings account, except you can earn much more interest. In some cases, you can get an annual percentage yield (APY) that is 10 times higher than the national average savings account rate. In fact, HYSAs currently offer some of the highest rates available on deposit products, with some financial institutions advertising APYs over 4%. High-yield savings accounts typically have no minimum opening balance requirements or monthly fees, though some banks may require you to maintain a minimum balance to earn interest or avoid a monthly service charge. Depending on the financial institution, you may earn the same rate regardless of your balance, or your APY may be tiered based on your balance. High-yield savings accounts vs. traditional savings accounts High-yield savings accounts work the same way traditional savings accounts do; the main difference is the interest rate. Savings account interest rates are typically less than 1%, while high-yield savings accounts offer rates as high as 4% or more. Fees, restrictions, and minimum deposit requirements depend on the financial institution for both account types, and both types of accounts are FDIC-insured. Read more: High-yield savings account vs. traditional savings account: Which one is better? Why open a savings account? What is APY? A high-yield savings account’s interest rate represents how much you’ll earn in simple interest (interest earned on the principal balance). The annual percentage yield (APY) is the rate of return, including compound interest, which is the interest you earn on the principal balance and accrued interest. Most savings accounts compound interest daily or monthly. The more often interest compounds, the faster your money will grow. HYSAs come with variable interest rates. That means your bank or credit union can change your APY at any time. Generally, APYs increase when the economy is doing well, and the Federal Reserve raises its benchmark rate. Conversely, rates can drop when the economy weakens, and the Fed lowers rates. Read more: What is annual percentage yield (APY)? What is a good savings account interest rate? What is compound interest, and how is it calculated? Savings interest rates today Pros and cons of high-yield savings accounts There are many benefits of opening a high-yield savings account, particularly the opportunity to earn a competitive rate on your balance. However, there are some drawbacks to consider as well. Let’s take a closer look at the pros and cons of high-yield savings accounts: Pros: Higher interest rates: You’ll generally earn more interest than you would with a traditional savings account. Compound interest: Compounding interest helps your balance grow more quickly. Interest in an HYSA may compound daily or monthly. Accessibility: These accounts are a great place to stash money you may need to access quickly, such as your emergency fund. Other types of accounts, such as certificates of deposit (CDs), offer high rates but impose penalties if you withdraw money prior to the maturity date. Minimal or no fees: Fees with high-yield savings accounts are rare, so you won’t need to worry about these costs eating into your balance. Low-risk: High-yield savings accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). Plus, unlike investments, account performance isn’t tied to the stock market and you can’t lose money, making HYSAs a low-risk option for your money. Cons: Variable rates: Your savings account’s APY can increase or decrease over time. While individual banks set rates at their discretion, these rates are loosely tied to the federal funds rate. Banks may choose to increase or decrease savings rates when the Fed adjusts its target rate. Minimum balance requirement: Some accounts may have a high minimum opening deposit. Tiered APYs: Some banks may have tiered APYs depending on the deposit amount. For instance, you may earn a higher rate if you deposit $5,000 vs. $100. So, while a $5,000 deposit isn’t necessarily required, it could result in a better APY. Better for short-term savings: High-yield savings accounts aren’t the best choice for long-term savings goals, like retirement. Investment accounts tend to offer higher long-term returns. Withdrawal limits may apply: Depending on your bank, you may have a limit on monthly withdrawals. Read more: Understanding the pros and cons of high-yield savings accounts Alternatives to high-yield savings accounts An HYSA can be a smart place to store your savings, but it's not your only option. Here's a look at some of the alternatives you may want to consider. Money market accounts Money market accounts and high-yield savings accounts both offer higher interest rates compared to traditional savings accounts. However, these accounts come with different features. For instance, MMAs typically offer check-writing abilities and debit cards, though they might require higher minimum balances to earn the top interest rates. High-yield savings accounts, on the other hand, are designed to store your savings longer-term with fewer withdrawal options. Learn more about money market accounts vs. high-yield savings accounts. Read more: Money market account vs. high-yield savings account: Which is right for you? CDs Like high-yield savings accounts, CDs can provide a safe place to store your savings while earning a competitive return. The big difference is that CDs require you to lock in your money for a set period, known as the term, which can range from a few months to several years. For this reason, CDs are a better option for people who don't need immediate access to their funds. Learn more about high-yield savings accounts vs. CDs. Read more: High-yield savings account vs. CD: Which is right for you? Investing High-yield savings accounts and investing serve vastly different financial goals and risk profiles. HYSAs provide stable, low-risk returns with interest rates higher than traditional savings accounts. They're best for short-term financial goals or emergency funds due to their liquidity and FDIC insurance. Investing in bonds, stocks, mutual funds, and other securities typically involves higher risk — but also the potential for higher returns over the long run. Investing your money makes more sense for long-term financial goals like retirement since the returns generally outpace inflation and help grow wealth over time.

Historical savings rates Today's savings account rates are the highest they've been in more than a decade, making it a great time to put your money in one. Here's a look at how historical savings rates have changed since 2014. Tips for finding the best high-yield savings account Competitive rates are great, but considering other factors besides APY can help you find an account that best meets your needs. New account offers Look at high-yield savings account offers for new depositors with high APYs, low to no account fees, and are free to open. High savings account rates will earn you more interest, but the financial institution offering those rates might not necessarily be the best option for your finances, so do your research before opening an account. Required deposits Research applicable deposit requirements. Is there a minimum initial deposit requirement? Do any other deposit requirements apply? Are there tiered APYs depending on your deposit amount? Fees Some accounts may have monthly maintenance fees or other fees. Look into which fees may apply before opening a new account. Accessibility Understand how you can access your money before opening a new account. For example, can you log into an online dashboard? Does your bank have a mobile app? Is it connected to an ATM network? Deposit options Review available deposit options. Are mobile check deposits via a mobile banking app an option? Can you make direct deposits via an ATM? Account linking Look into whether you can link your new account to an existing checking account at another bank. Make sure there are no restrictions or waiting periods when it comes to accessing your money. Read more: How to choose the right high-yield savings account for you How to open a high-yield savings account Once you’ve determined the best high-yield savings account for you, opening one is simple and can be done in person or online. You’ll generally need to provide your personal information, proof of identity, and address to open a new account. Make sure you have your driver’s license, Social Security number, and copies of a recent mortgage statement or utility bill. Depending on the account, a minimum deposit amount could apply when you open your HYSA account. If that’s the case, you’ll also need to be ready to transfer money from an existing account to meet the deposit requirement. Learn more about opening a high-yield savings account . HYSA frequently asked questions (FAQs) Is your money safe in a HYSA? As long as your account is held by an FDIC- or NCUA-insured institution, your money is federally insured up to the $250,000 limit. How often do HYSA rates change? Savings account rates are subject to change at your bank’s discretion. To get the most recent rate information for the accounts you’re considering, you’ll need to visit those institutions’ websites or call them directly to learn more. Can you withdraw money from a HYSA? Yes, you can withdraw money from a high-yield savings account. However, these accounts may have rules in place regarding the maximum number of withdrawals you can make within a given month or statement period without incurring a fee. What is the highest paying high-yield savings account? Among our list of the 10 best high-yield savings accounts, the highest rate available is 5.05% APY, offered by EverBank. Do you pay taxes on high-yield savings accounts? Yes, the interest earnings from high-yield savings accounts are considered taxable income. You should receive a Form 1099-INT from your bank if you earn more than $10 in interest during the year, which you need to report on your tax return. Are high-yield savings accounts still worth it? High-yield savings accounts are one of the best places to keep extra cash, whether for your emergency fund or short-term savings. The best rates currently hover between 4% and 5% APY. Can savings account interest rates change? Interest rates on savings accounts can change at any time. They're influenced by several factors, including the federal funds rate, general economic conditions, and individual bank policies. What type of bank account gives the most interest? Typically, high-yield savings accounts, CDs, and money market accounts offer higher interest rates compared to standard checking or savings accounts. Can you lose money in a high-yield savings account? In most cases, you won't lose money in a high-yield savings account as long as the financial institution is insured by the FDIC or NCUA, which cover up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution, per ownership category. However, there are certain instances when your HYSA could lose money. Best high-yield savings account methodology Our grading system, collected and carefully reviewed by our personal finance experts, comprised nearly 300 data points for approximately 30 federally insured savings accounts to develop our list of the top 10 high-yield savings accounts. We considered accounts with yields higher than the national average for traditional savings accounts. We evaluated these accounts according to several key metrics, including annual percentage yield, minimum opening deposit, minimum balance requirement, monthly fees, compounding frequency, and more. The accounts on our list could earn a maximum of 45 points across all metrics. Here’s a closer look at the categories we considered: Annual percentage yield (APY): Accounts with higher APYs were rewarded with more points than those with lower APYs. Note that rates on our list are current at the time of publishing but are subject to change at any time. Minimum balance to earn interest: Some banks and credit unions require a minimum balance to earn the advertised rate. We favored accounts that had no or low minimum balance requirements. Minimum opening deposit: Many high-yield savings accounts require a minimum deposit to open an account. High-yield savings accounts with no or low minimum deposit requirements were given preference in our rankings. Monthly fees: It’s not uncommon for high-yield accounts to charge a monthly maintenance or service fee. We rewarded accounts with no monthly fees. Compounding frequency: Compounding can happen daily, monthly, or even annually. We awarded more points to accounts that compound interest frequently. Account bonus: Accounts with a current bonus promotion earned extra points. Maximum bonus amount: We awarded more points to the accounts with higher welcome bonuses. Customer service contact methods: Our team awarded one point for every contact method available to customers (phone, email, chat). Mobile app rating: High-yield savings accounts at banks with a higher average mobile app rating on the Apple and Google storefronts scored more points than those with lower user ratings.

In the wake of the recent elections in Germany, European markets are reflecting uncertainty as investors weigh potential impacts. While the euro (EURUSD=X) briefly surged due to conservative victories, market reactions have been mixed as traders continue to eye global opportunities. In the US there is a wait-and-see approach regarding tariffs, with expectations that the situation will ultimately be resolved, similar to President Trump's negotiation style. FedWatch Advisors founder and CIO Ben Emons joins Market Domination Overtime hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to share his insights on the market environment (^GSPC,&nbsp;^IXIC,&nbsp;^DJI), stating that markets are still \"banking\" on Trump's tariffs to go into effect early March. \"It will ultimately all come together because this is the way President Trump sort of manages this process, right? A lot of threats,\" Emons says. \"But then it gets the parties at the table and there's a conclusion\" Regarding the German elections, Emons highlights the significant shift that could come by saying \"it's a big swing to the right again in Germany, which is happening across the Eurozone over the last several years.\" \"I think it's really a reflection of voters just being really uneasy with everything that was done during the pandemic, in the aftermath,\" he adds.

The vote was a test of investor views about the value of DEI programs, which many companies added or beefed up starting in 2020 amid the Black Lives Matter movement. Growing conservative pushback has led several large U.S. companies, including Meta, Alphabet and Amazon.com, to drop their DEI goals before and after Donald Trump's return to the U.S. presidency.
